       " 'Title: Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs\\n\\nAuthor: Judi Barrett\\n\\nWe were all sitting around the big kitchen table.\\n\\nIt was Saturday morning.\\n\\nPancake morning.\\n\\nMom was squeezing oranges for juice.\\n\\nHenry and I were betting on how many pancakes we each could eat.\\n\\nAnd grandpa was doing the flipping.\\n\\nSeconds later, something flew through the air headed toward the kitchen ceiling . . . and landed right on Henry.\\n\\nAfter we realized that the flying object was only a pancake, we all laughed, even Grandpa.\\n\\nBreakfast continued quite uneventfully.\\n\\nAll the other pancakes landed in the pan.\\n\\nAnd all of them were eaten, even the one that landed on Henry.\\n\\nThat night, touched off by the pancake incident at breakfast, Grandpa told us the best tall-tale bedtime story he’d ever told.\\n\\n\"Across an ocean, over lots of huge bumpy mountains, across three hot deserts, and one smaller ocean . . . there lay the tiny town of Chewandswallow.\\n\\nIn most ways, it was very much like any other tiny town.\\n\\nIt had a Main Street lined with stores, houses with trees and gardens around them, a schoolhouse, about three hundred people, and some assorted cats and dogs.\\n\\nBut there were no food stores in the town of Chewandswallow.\\n\\nThey didn’t need any.\\n\\nThe sky supplied all the food they could possibly want.\\n\\nThe only thing that was really different about Chewandswallow was its weather.\\n\\nIt came three times a day, at breakfast, lunch, and dinner.\\n\\nEverything that everyone ate came from the sky.\\n\\nWhatever the weather served, that was what they ate.\\n\\nBut it never rained rain.\\n\\nIt never snowed snow.\\n\\nAnd it never blew just wind.\\n\\nIt rained things like soup and juice.\\n\\nIt snowed mashed potatoes and green peas.\\n\\nAnd sometimes the wind blew in storms of hamburgers.\\n\\nThe people could watch the weather report on television in the morning and they would even hear a prediction for the next day’s food.\\n\\nWhen the townspeople went outside, they carried their plates, cups, glasses, forks, spoons, knives and napkins with them.  \\n\\nThat way they would always be prepared for any kind of weather.\\n\\nIf there were leftovers, and there usually were, the people took them home and put them in their refrigerators in case they got hungry between meals.\\n\\nThe menu varied.\\n\\nBy the time they woke up in the morning, breakfast was coming down.\\n\\nAfter a brief shower of orange juice, low clouds of sunny-side up eggs moved in followed by pieces of toast.\\n\\nButter and jelly sprinkled down for the toast.\\n\\nAnd most of the time it rained milk afterwards.\\n\\nFor lunch one day, frankfurters, already in their rolls, blew in from the northwest at about five miles an hour.\\n\\nThere were mustard clouds nearby.\\n\\nThen the wind shifted to the east and brought in baked beans.\\n\\nA drizzle of soda finished off the meal.\\n\\nDinner one night consisted of lamb chops, becoming heavy at times, with occasional ketchup.\\n\\nPeriods of peas and baked potatoes were followed by gradual clearing, with a wonderful Jell-O setting in the west.\\n\\nThe Sanitation Department of Chewandswallow had a rather unusual job for a sanitation department.\\n\\nIt had to remove the goods that fell on the houses and sidewalks and lawns.\\n\\nThe workers cleaned things up after every meal and fed all the dogs and cats.\\n\\nThen they emptied some of it into the surrounding oceans for the fish and turtles and whales to eat.\\n\\nThe rest of the food was put back into the earth so that the soil would be richer for the people’s flower gardens.\\n\\nLife for the townspeople was delicious until the weather took a turn for the worse.\\n\\nOne day there was nothing but Gorgonzola cheese all day long.\\n\\nThe next day there was only broccoli, all overcooked.\\n\\nAnd the next day there were brussel sprouts and peanut butter with mayonnaise.\\n\\nAnother day there was a pea soup fog.\\n\\nNo one could see where they were going and they could barely find the rest of the meal that got stuck in the fog.\\n\\nThe food was getting larger and larger, and so were the portions.\\n\\nThe people were getting frightened.\\n\\nViolent storms blew up frequently.\\n\\nAwful things were happening.\\n\\nOne Tuesday there was a hurricane of bread and rolls all day long and into the night.\\n\\nThere were soft rolls and hard rolls, some with seeds and some without.\\n\\nThere was white bread and rye and whole wheat toast.\\n\\nMost of it was larger than they had ever seen bread and rolls before.\\n\\nIt was a terrible day.\\n\\nEveryone had to stay indoors.\\n\\nRoofs were damaged, and the Sanitation Department was beside itself.\\n\\nThe mess took the workers four days to clean up, and the sea was full of floating rolls.\\n\\nTo help out, the people piled up as much bread as they could in their backyards.\\n\\nThe birds picked at it a bit, but it just stayed there and got staler and staler.\\n\\nThere was a storm of pancakes one morning and a downpour of maple syrup that nearly flooded the town.  \\n\\nA huge pancake covered the school.\\n\\nNo one could get it off because of its weight, so they had to close the school.\\n\\nLunch one day brought fifteen-inch drifts of cream cheese and jelly sandwiches.\\n\\nEveryone ate themselves sick and the day ended with a stomachache.\\n\\nThere was an awful salt and pepper wind accompanied by an even worse tornado.\\n\\nPeople were sneezing themselves silly and running to avoid the tomatoes.\\n\\nThe town was a mess.\\n\\nThere were seeds and pulp everywhere.\\n\\nThe sanitation department gave up.\\n\\nThe job was too big.\\n\\nEveryone feared for their lives.\\n\\nThey couldn’t go outside most of the time.\\n\\nMany houses had been badly damaged by giant meatballs, stores were boarded up and there was no more school for the children.\\n\\nSo a decision was made to abandon the town of Chewandswallow.\\n\\nIt was a matter of survival.\\n\\nThe people glued together giant pieces of stale bread sandwich-style with peanut butter . . . took the absolute necessities with them, and set sail on their rafts for a new land.\\n\\nAfter being afloat for a week, they finally reached a small coastal town, which welcomed them.\\n\\nThe bread had held up surprisingly well, well enough for them to build temporary houses for themselves out of it.\\n\\nThe children began school again, and the adults all tried to find places for themselves in the new land.\\n\\nThe biggest change they had to make was getting used to buying food at a supermarket.\\n\\nThe found it odd that food was kept on shelves, packaged in boxes, cans and bottles.  \\n\\nMeat that had to be cooked was kept in large refrigerators.\\n\\nNothing came down from the sky except rain and snow.\\n\\nThe clouds above their heads were not made of fried eggs.\\n\\nNo one ever got hit by a hamburger again.\\n\\nAnd nobody dared to go back to Chewandswallow to find out what had happened to it.\\n\\nThey were too afraid.\"\\n\\nHenry and I were awake until the very end of Grandpa’s story.\\n\\nI remember his goodnight kiss.\\n\\nThe next morning we woke up to see snow falling outside our window.\\n\\nWe ran downstairs for breakfast and ate it a little faster than usual so we could go sledding with Grandpa.\\n\\nIt’s funny, but even as we were sliding down the hill we thought we saw a giant pat of butter at the top, and we could almost smell the mashed potatoes.\\n\\nThe End',\n",

       " 'Title: Sylvester and the Magic Pebble\\n\\nAuthor: William Steig\\n\\nSylvester Duncan lived with his mother and father at Acorn Road in Oatsdale.\\n\\nOne of his hobbies was collecting pebbles of unusual shape and color.\\n\\nOn a rainy Saturday, during vacation he found a quite extraordinary one. \\n\\nIt was flaming red, shiny, and perfectly round, like a marble. \\n\\nAs he was studying this remarkable pebble, he began to shiver, probably from excitement, and the rain felt cold on his back. \\n\\n\"I wish it would stop raining,\" he said.\\n\\nTo his great surprise the rain stopped. \\n\\nIt didn’t stop gradually as rains usually do. \\n\\nIt CEASED. \\n\\nThe drops vanished on the way down, the clouds disappeared, everything was dry, and the sun was shining as if rain had never existed.\\n\\nIn all his young life Sylvester had never had a wish gratified so quickly. \\n\\nIt struck him that magic must be at work, and he guessed that the magic must be in the remarkable-looking red pebble. \\n\\n(Where indeed it was.) \\n\\nTo make a test, he put the pebble on the ground and said, \"I wish it would rain again.\" \\n\\nNothing happened.\\n\\nBut when he said the same thing holding the Pebble in his hoof, the sky turned black, there was lightning and a clap of thunder, and the rain came shooting down.\\n\\n\"What a lucky day this is!\" thought Sylvester.\\n\\n\"From now on I can have anything I want.\\n\\nMy father and mother can have anything they want. \\n\\nMy relatives, my friends, and anybody at all can have everything anybody wants!\"\\n\\nHe wished the sunshine back in the sky, and he wished a wart on his left hind fetlock would disappear, and it did, and he started home, eager to amaze his father and mother with his magic pebble.\\n\\nHe could hardly wait to see their faces. \\n\\nMaybe they wouldn’t even believe him at first.\\n\\nAs he was crossing strawberry Hill, thinking of some of the many, many things he could wish for, he was startled to see a mean, hungry lion looking right at him from behind some tall grass. \\n\\nHe was frightened. \\n\\nIf he hadn’t been so frightened, he could have made the lion disappear, or he could have wished himself safe at home with his father and mother.\\n\\nHe could have wished the lion would turn into a butterfly or a daisy or a gnat. \\n\\nHe could have wished many things, but he panicked and couldn’t think carefully.\\n\\n\"I wish I were a rock,\" he said, and he became a rock.\\n\\nThe lion came bounding over, sniffed the rock a hundred times, walked around and around it, and went away confused, perplexed, puzzled, and bewildered. \\n\\n\"I saw that little donkey as clear as day. \\n\\nMaybe I’m going crazy,\" he muttered.\\n\\nAnd there was Sylvester, a rock on Strawberry Hill, with the magic pebble lying right beside him on the ground, and he was unable to pick it up. \\n\\n\"Oh, how I wish I were myself again,\" he thought, but nothing happened. \\n\\nHe had to be touching the pebble to make the magic work, but there was nothing he could do about it.\\n\\nHis thoughts began to race like mad. \\n\\nHe was scared and worried. \\n\\nBeing helpless, he felt hopeless. \\n\\nHe imagined all the possibilities, and eventually he realized that his only chance of becoming himself again was for someone to find the red pebble and to wish that the rock next to it would be a donkey. \\n\\nSomeone would surely find the red pebble – it was so bright and shiny - but what on earth would make them wish that a rock were a donkey? \\n\\nThe chance was one in a billion at best.\\n\\nSylvester fell asleep.\\n\\nWhat else could he do? \\n\\nNight came with many stars.\\n\\nMeanwhile, back at home, Mr. and Mrs. Duncan paced the floor, frantic with worry. \\n\\nSylvester had never come home later than dinner time. \\n\\nWhere could he be? \\n\\nThey stayed up all night wondering what had happened, expecting that Sylvester would surely turn up by morning. \\n\\nBut he didn’t, of course.\\n\\nMrs. Duncan cried a lot and Mr. Duncan did his best to soothe her. \\n\\nBoth longed to have their dear son with them.\\n\\n\"I will never scold Sylvester again as long as I live,\" said Mrs. Duncan, \"no matter what he does.\"\\n\\nAt dawn, they went about inquiring of all the neighbors.\\n\\nThey talked to all the children - the puppies, the kittens, the colts, the piglets. \\n\\nNo one had seen Sylvester since the day before yesterday.\\n\\nThey went to the police. \\n\\nThe police could not find their child.\\n\\nAll the dogs in Oatsdale went searching for him. \\n\\nThey sniffed behind every rock and tree and blade of grass, into every nook and gully of the neighborhood and beyond, but found not a scent of him. \\n\\nThey sniffed the rock on strawberry Hill, but it smelled like a rock. \\n\\nIt didn’t smell like Sylvester.\\n\\nAfter a month of searching the same places over and over again, and inquiring of the same animals over and over again, Mr. and Mrs. Duncan no longer knew what to do.\\n\\nThey concluded that something dreadful must have happened and that they would probably never see their son again. \\n\\n(Though all the time he was less than a mile away.)\\n\\nThey tried their best to be happy, to go about their usual ways. \\n\\nBut their usual ways included Sylvester and they were always reminded of him. \\n\\nThey were miserable. \\n\\nLife had no meaning for them any more.\\n\\nNight followed day and day followed night over and over again. \\n\\nSylvester on the hill woke up less and less often.\\n\\nWhen he was awake, he was only hopeless and unhappy.\\n\\nHe felt he would be a rock forever and he tried to get used to it. \\n\\nHe went into an endless sleep. \\n\\nThe days grew colder.\\n\\nFall came with the leaves changing color. \\n\\nThen the leaves fell and the grass bent to the ground.\\n\\nThen it was winter. \\n\\nThe winds blew, this way and that.\\n\\nIt snowed. \\n\\nMostly, the animals stayed indoors, living on the food they had stored up.\\n\\nOne day a wolf sat on the rock that was Sylvester and howled and howled because he was hungry.\\n\\nThen the snows melted. \\n\\nThe earth warmed up in the spring sun and things budded.\\n\\nLeaves were on the trees again.\\n\\nFlowers showed their young faces.\\n\\nOne day in May, Mr. Duncan insisted that his wife go with him on a picnic. \\n\\n\"Let’s cheer up,\" he said. \\n\\n\"Let us try to live again and be happy even though Sylvester, our angel, is no longer with us.\" \\n\\nThey went to Strawberry Hill.\\n\\nMrs. Duncan sat down on the rock. \\n\\nThe warmth of his own mother sitting on him woke Sylvester up from his deep winter sleep. \\n\\nHow he wanted to shout, \"Mother! Father!\\n\\nIt’s me, Sylvester, I’m right here!\" \\n\\nBut he couldn’t talk. \\n\\nHe had no voice. \\n\\nHe was stone-dumb.\\n\\nMr. Duncan walked aimlessly about while Mrs. Duncan set out the picnic food on the rock - alfalfa sandwiches, pickled oats, sassafras salad, timothy compote. \\n\\nSuddenly Mr. Duncan saw the red pebble. \\n\\n\"What a fantastic pebble!\" he exclaimed. \\n\\n\"Sylvester would have loved it for his collection.\"\\n\\nHe put the pebble on the rock.\\n\\nThey sat down to eat. \\n\\nSylvester was now as wide awake as a donkey that was a rock could possibly be. \\n\\nMrs. Duncan felt some mysterious excitement. \\n\\n\"You know, Father,\" she said suddenly, \"I have the strangest feeling that our dear Sylvester is still alive and not far away.\"\\n\\n\"I am, I am!\" Sylvester wanted to shout, but he couldn’t.\\n\\nIf only he had realized that the pebble resting on his back was the magic pebble!\\n\\n\"Oh, how I wish he were here with us on this lovely May day,\" said Mrs. Duncan. \\n\\nMr. Duncan looked sadly at the ground. \\n\\n\"Don’t you wish it too, Father?\" she said. \\n\\nHe looked at her as if to say, \"How can you ask such a question?\"\\n\\nMr. and Mrs. Duncan looked at each other with great sorrow.\\n\\n\"I wish I were myself again, I wish I were my real self again!\" thought Sylvester.\\n\\nAnd in less than an instant, he was!\\n\\nYou can imagine the scene that followed - the embraces, the kisses, the questions, the answers, the loving looks, and the fond exclamations!\\n\\nWhen they had eventually calmed down a bit, and had gotten home, Mr. Duncan put the magic pebble in an iron safe.\\n\\nSome day they might want to use it, but really, for now, what more could they wish for? \\n\\nThey all had all that they wanted.\\n\\nThe End',\n",

a sound a friend had told me I’d never hear - the ringing bells of Santa’s sleigh.\\n\\n\"There is no Santa,\" my friend has insisted but I knew he was wrong.\\n\\nLate that night I did hear sounds, though not of ringing bells.\\n\\nFrom outside came the sounds of hissing steam and squeaking metal.\\n\\nI looked through my window and saw a train standing perfectly still in front of my house.\\n\\nIt was wrapped in an apron of  steam. \\n\\nSnowflakes fell lightly around it. \\n\\nA conductor  stood at the open door of  one of the  cars. \\n\\nHe took a large pocket watch from  his vest, then looked up at my window.\\n\\nI put on my slippers and robe.\\n\\nI tiptoed downstairs and out the door.\\n\\n \"All aboard,\" the conductor cried out. \\n\\nI ran up to him.\\n\\n\"Well,\" he said, \"are you coming?\"\\n\\n\"Where?\" I asked.\\n\\n\"Why, to the North Pole of course,\" was his answer. \\n\\n\"This is the Polar Express.\" \\n\\nI took his outstretched hand and he pulled me aboard.\\n\\nThe train was filled with other children, all in their pajamas and nightgowns. \\n\\nWe sang Christmas carols and ate candies with nougat  centers as white as snow. \\n\\nWe drank hot cocoa as thick and rich as melted chocolate  bars. \\n\\nOutside the lights of towns and villages flickered in the distance as the Polar Express raced northward.\\n\\nSoon there were no more lights to be seen. \\n\\nWe traveled through cold, dark forests, where lean wolves roamed and white-tailed rabbits hid from our train as it thundered through the quiet wilderness.\\n\\nWe climbed mountains so high it seemed as if we would  scrape the moon. \\n\\nBut the Polar Express never slowed down.\\n\\nFaster and faster we ran along, rolling over peaks and through valleys like a  car on a roller coaster.\\n\\nThe mountains turned into hills, the hills to snow-covered plains.’\\n\\nWe crossed a barren desert of ice - the Great Polar Ice Cap. \\n\\nLights appeared in the distance. \\n\\nThey looked like the lights of a strange ocean liner sailing on a frozen sea.\\n\\n’\"There,\" said the conductor, \"is the North Pole.\"\\n\\nThe North Pole. \\n\\nIt was a huge city standing alone at the top of the world, filled with factories where  every Christmas toy  was made.\\n\\nAt first we saw no elves.\\n\\n\"They are gathering at the center of the city,\" the conductor told us. \\n\\n\"That is where Santa will give the first gift of Christmas.\"\\n\\n\"Who receives the first gift?\" we all asked.\\n\\nThe conductor answered.\\n\\n\"He will choose one of you.\"\\n\\n\"Look,\" shouted one of the children, \"the elves.\" \\n\\nOutside we saw hundreds of elves. \\n\\nAs our train drew closer to the center of the North Pole, we slowed to a crawl, so crowded were the streets with Santa’s helpers. \\n\\nWhen the Polar Express could go no farther, we stopped and the conductor led us outside.\\n\\nWe pressed through the crowd to the edge of a large, open circle. \\n\\nIn front of us stood Santa’s sleigh. \\n\\nThe reindeer were excited. \\n\\nThey pranced and paced, ringing the silver sleigh bells that hung from their harnesses. \\n\\nIt was a magical sound, like nothing I’d ever heard. \\n\\nAcross the circle, the elves moved apart and Santa Claus appeared. \\n\\nThe elves cheered wildly.\\n\\nHe marched over to us and, pointing to me, said, \"Let’s have this fellow here.\" \\n\\nHe jumped into his sleigh. \\n\\nThe conductor handed me up. \\n\\nI sat on Santa’s knee and he asked, \"Now, what would you like for Christmas?\"\\n\\nI knew that I could have any gift I could imagine. \\n\\nBut the thing I wanted most for Christmas was not inside Santa’s giant bag. \\n\\nWhat I wanted more than anything was one silver bell from Santa’s sleigh. \\n\\nWhen I asked, Santa smiled. \\n\\nThen he gave me a hug and told an elf to cut a bell from a reindeer’s harness. \\n\\nThe elf tossed it up to Santa. \\n\\nHe stood, holding the bell high above him, and called out, \"The first gift of Christmas!\"\\n\\nA clock struck midnight as the elves roared their approval.\\n\\nSanta handed the bell to me, and I put it in my bathrobe pocket. \\n\\nThe conductor helped me down from the sleigh.\\n\\n Santa shouted out the reindeer’s names and cracked his whip.\\n\\nHis team charged forward and climbed into the air.  \\n\\nSanta circled once above us, then disappeared in the cold, dark polar sky.\\n\\nAs soon as we were back inside the Polar Express, the other children asked to see the bell. \\n\\nI reached into my pocket but the only thing I felt was a hole. \\n\\nI had lost the silver bell from Santa Claus’s sleigh.\\n\\n\"Let’s hurry outside and look for it,\" one of the children said.\\n\\nBut the train gave a sudden lurch and started moving.\\n\\nWe were on our way home.\\n\\nIt broke my heart to lose the bell. \\n\\nWhen the train reached my house, I sadly left the other children. \\n\\nI stood at my doorway and waved good-bye.\\n\\nThe conductor said something from the moving train, but I couldn’t hear him. \\n\\n\"What?\" I yelled out.\\n\\nHe cupped his hands around his mouth. \\n\\n\"MERRY CHRISTMAS,\" he shouted.\\n\\nThe Polar Express let out a loud blast from its whistle and sped away.\\n\\nOn Christmas morning my little sister Sarah and I opened our  presents. \\n\\nWhen it looked as if everything had been unwrapped, Sarah found one last small box behind the tree.\\n\\nIt had my name on it. \\n\\nInside was the silver bell! \\n\\nThere was a note: \"Found this on the seat of my sleigh. \\n\\nFix that hole in your pocket.\" Signed, \"Mr. C.\"\\n\\nI shook the bell.\\n\\nIt made the most beautiful sound my sister and I had ever heard.\\n\\nBut my mother said, \"Oh, that’s too bad.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said my father, \"it’s broken.\"\\n\\nWhen I’d shaken the bell, my parents had not heard a sound.\\n\\nAt one time most of my friends could hear the bell, but as  years passed, it fell silent for all of them. \\n\\nEven Sarah found one Christmas that she could no longer hear its sweet sound. \\n\\nThough I’ve grown old, the bell still rings for me as it does for all who truly believe.',\n",

daisies.\\n\\nThen some trucks came and dumped big stones on the road, then some trucks with little stones, then some trucks with tar and sand, and finally a steam roller came and rolled it all smooth, and the road was done.\\n\\nNow the Little House watched the trucks and automobiles going back and forth to the city.\\n\\nGasoline stations . . . roadside stands . . . and small houses followed the new road.\\n\\nEveryone and everything moved much faster now than before.\\n\\nMore roads were made, and the countryside was divided into lots.\\n\\nMore houses and bigger houses . . . apartment houses and tenement houses . . . schools . . . stores . . . and garages spread over the land and crowded around the Little House.\\n\\nNo one wanted to live in her and take care of her any more.\\n\\nShe couldn’t be sold for gold or silver, so she just stayed there and watched.\\n\\nNow it was not so quiet and peaceful at night.\\n\\nNow the lights of the city were bright and very close, and the street lights shone all night.\\n\\n\"This must be living in the city,\" thought the Little House, and didn’t know whether she liked it or not.\\n\\nShe missed the field of daisies and the apple trees dancing in the moonlight.\\n\\nPretty soon there were trolley cars going back and forth in front of the Little House.\\n\\nThey went back and forth all day and part of the night.\\n\\nEveryone seemed to be very busy and everyone seemed to be in a hurry.\\n\\nPretty soon there was an elevated train going back and forth above the Little House.\\n\\nThe air was filled with dust and smoke, and the noise was so loud that it shook the Little House.\\n\\nNow she couldn’t tell when Spring came, or Summer or Fall, or Winter.\\n\\nIt al seemed about the same.\\n\\nPretty soon there was a subway going back and forth underneath the Little House.\\n\\nShe couldn’t see it, but she could feel and hear it.\\n\\nPeople were moving faster and faster.\\n\\nNo one noticed the Little House any more.\\n\\nThey hurried by without a glance.\\n\\nPretty soon they tore down the apartment houses and tenement houses around the Little House and started digging big cellars . . . one on each side.\\n\\nThe steam shovels dug down three stories on one side and four stories on the other side.\\n\\nPretty soon they started building up . . .\\n\\nThey built up twenty-five stories on one side and thirty-five stories on the other.\\n\\nNow the Little House only saw the sun at noon, and didn’t see the moon or starts at night at all because the lights of the city were too bright.\\n\\nShe didn’t like living in the city.\\n\\nAt night she used to dream of the country and the field of daisies and the apple trees dancing in the moonlight.\\n\\nThe Little House was very sad and lonely.\\n\\nHer paint was cracked and dirty . . .\\n\\nHer windows were broken and her shutters hung crookedly.\\n\\nShe looked shabby . . . though she was just as good a house as ever underneath.\\n\\nThen one fine morning in Spring along came the great-great-granddaughter of the man who built the Little House so well.\\n\\nShe saw the shabby Little House, but she didn’t hurry by.\\n\\nThere was something about the Little House that made her stop and look again.\\n\\nShe said to her husband, \"That Little House looks just like the Little House my grandmother lived in when she was a little girl, only that Little House was way out in the country on a hill covered with daisies and apple trees growing around.\"\\n\\nThe found out it was the very same house, so the went to the Movers to see if the Little House could be moved.\\n\\nThe Movers looked the Little House all over and said, \"Sure, this house is as good as ever.  \\n\\nShe’s build so well we could move her anywhere.\"\\n\\nSo they jacked up the Little House and put her on wheels.\\n\\nTraffic was held up for hours as they slowly moved her out of the city.\\n\\nAt first the Little House was frightened, but after she got used to it she rather liked it.\\n\\nThey rolled along the big road, and they rolled along the little roads, until they were way out in the country.\\n\\nWhen the Little House saw the green grass and heard the birds singing, she didn’t feel sad any more.\\n\\nThey went along and along, but they couldn’t seem to find just the right place.\\n\\nThey tried the Little House here, and they tried her there.\\n\\nFinally they saw a little hill in the middle of the field . . . and apple trees growing around.\\n\\n\"There,\" said the great-great-granddaughter, \"that’s just the place.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, it is,\" said the Little House to herself.\\n\\nA cellar was dug on top of the hill and slowly they moved the house from the road to the hill.\\n\\nThe windows and shutters were fixed and once again they painted her a lovely shade of pink.\\n\\nAs the Little House settled down on her new foundation, she smiled happily.\\n\\nOnce again she could watch the sun and moon and stars.\\n\\nOnce again she could watch Spring and Summer and Fall and Winter come and go.\\n\\nOnce again she was lived in and taken care of.\\n\\nNever again would she be curious about the city . . .\\n\\nNever again would she want to live there . . .\\n\\nThe stars twinkled above her . . .\\n\\nA new moon was coming up . . .\\n\\nIt was Spring . . . and all was peaceful in the country.',\n",

You are crazy with greed.\\n\\nThere is no one on earth who would buy that fool Thneed!\"\\n\\nBut the very next minute I proved he was wrong.\\n\\nFor, just at the minute, a chap came along, and he thought that the Thneed I had knitted was great.\\n\\nHe happily bought it for three ninety-eight.\\n\\nI laughed at the Lorax, \"You poor stupid guy!\\n\\nYou never can tell what some people will buy.\"\\n\\n\"I repeat,\" cried the Lorax, \"I speak for the trees!\"\\n\\n\"I’m busy,\" I told him.\\n\\n\"Shut up, if you please.\"\\n\\nI rushed ’cross the room, and in no time at all, built a radio-phone. \\n\\nI put in a quick call.\\n\\nI called all my brothers and uncles and aunts and I said, \"Listen here!

       " 'Title: A Bad Case of Stripes\\n\\nAuthor: David Shannon\\n\\nCamilla Cream loved lima beans.\\n\\nBut she never ate them.\\n\\nAll of her friends hated lima beans, and she wanted to fit in.\\n\\nCamilla was always worried about what other people thought of her.\\n\\nToday she was fretting even more than usual.\\n\\nIt was the first day of school, and she couldn’t decide what to wear.\\n\\nThere were so many people to impress!\\n\\nShe tried on forty-two outfits, but none seemed quite right.\\n\\nShe put on a pretty red dress and looked in the mirror.\\n\\nThen she screamed.\\n\\nHer mother ran into the room, and she screamed, too. \\n\\n\"Oh my heavens!\" she cried. \\n\\n\"You’re completely covered with stripes!\"\\n\\nThis was certainly true. \\n\\nCamilla was striped from head to toe.\\n\\nShe looked like a rainbow.\\n\\nMrs. Cream felt Camilla’s forehead. \\n\\n\"Do you feel all right?\" she asked.\\n\\n\"I feel fine,\" Camilla answered, \"but just look at me!\"\\n\\n\"You get back in bed this instant,\" her mother ordered. \\n\\n\"You’re not going to school today.\"\\n\\nCamilla was relieved. \\n\\nShe didn’t want to miss the first day of school, but she was afraid of what the other kids would say. \\n\\nAnd she had no idea what to wear with those crazy stripes.\\n\\nThat afternoon, Dr. Bumble came to examine Camilla. \\n\\n\"Most extraordinary!\" he exclaimed. \\n\\n\"l’ve never seen anything like it. \\n\\nAre you having any coughing, sneezing, runny nose, aches, pains, chills, hot flashes, dizziness, drowsiness, shortness of breath, or uncontrollable twitching?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" Camilla told him. \\n\\n\"I feel fine.\"\\n\\n\"Well then,\" Dr. Bumble said, turning to Mrs. Cream, \"l don’t see any reason why she shouldn’t go to school tomorrow. \\n\\nHere’s some ointment that should help clear up those stripes in a few days.\\n\\nIf it doesn’t, you know where to reach me.\" \\n\\nAnd off he went.\\n\\nThe next day was a disaster. \\n\\nEveryone at school laughed at Camilla.\\n\\nThey called her \"Camilla Crayon\" and \"Night of the Living Lollipop.\"\\n\\nShe tried her best to act as if everything were normal, but when the class said the Pledge of Allegiance, her stripes turned red, white, and blue, and she broke out in stars!\\n\\nThe other kids thought this was great. \\n\\nOne yelled out, \"Let’s see some purple polka dots!\" \\n\\nSure enough, Camilla turned all purple polka-dotty. \\n\\nSomeone else shouted, \"Checkerboard!\" and a pattern of squares covered her skin. \\n\\nSoon everyone was calling out different shapes and colors, and poor Camilla was changing faster than you can change channels on a T.V.\\n\\nThat night, Mr. Harms, the school principal, called.\\n\\n \"l’m sorry, Mrs. Cream,\" he said. \\n\\n\"I’m going to have to ask you to keep Camilla home from school. \\n\\nShe’s just too much of a distraction, and I’ve been getting calls from the other parents. \\n\\nThey’re afraid those stripes may be contagious.\"\\n\\nCamilla was so embarrassed. \\n\\nShe couldn’t believe that two days ago everyone liked her. \\n\\nNow, nobody wanted to be in the same room with her.\\n\\nHer father tried to make her feel better. \\n\\n\"Is there anything I can get you, sweetheart?\" he asked.\\n\\n\"No, thank you,\" sighed Camilla. \\n\\nWhat she really wanted was a nice plate of lima beans, but she had been laughed at enough for one day.\\n\\n\"Hmm, well, yes, I see,\" Dr. Bumble mumbled when Mr. Cream phoned the next day. \\n\\n\"I think I’d better bring in the Specialists. \\n\\nWe’ll be right over.\"\\n\\nAbout an hour later, Dr. Bumble arrived with four people in long white coats. \\n\\nHe introduced them to the Creams. \\n\\n\"This is Dr. Grop, Dr. Sponge, Dr. Cricket, and Dr. Young.\"\\n\\nThen the Specialists went to work on Camilla. \\n\\nThey squeezed and jabbed, tapped and tested. \\n\\nIt was very uncomfortable.\\n\\n\"Well, it’s not the mumps,\" concluded Dr. Grop.\\n\\n\"Or the measles,\" said Dr. Sponge.\\n\\n\"Definitely not chicken pox,\" put in Dr. Cricket.\\n\\n\"Or sunburn,\" said Dr. Young.\\n\\n\"Try these,\" said the Specialists.\\n\\nThey each handed her a bottle filled with different colored pills.\\n\\n\"Take one of each before bed,\" said Dr. Grop.\\n\\nThen they filed out the front door, followed by Dr. Bumble.\\n\\nThat night, Camilla took her medicine. \\n\\nIt was awful. \\n\\nWhen she woke up the next morning, she did feel different, but when she got dressed, her clothes didn’t fit right. \\n\\nShe looked in the mirror, and there, staring back at her, was a giant, multi colored pill with her face on it.\\n\\nDr. Bumble rushed over as soon as Mrs. Cream called. \\n\\nBut this time, instead of the Specialists, he brought the Experts.\\n\\nDr. Gourd and Mr. Mellon were the finest scientific minds in the land. \\n\\nOnce again, Camilla was poked and prodded, looked at and listened to.\\n\\nThe Experts wrote down lots of numbers. \\n\\nThen they huddled together and whispered.\\n\\nDr. Gourd finally spoke. \\n\\n\"It might be a virus,\" he announced with authority. \\n\\nSuddenly, fuzzy little virus balls appeared all over Camilla.\\n\\n\"Or possibly some form of bacteria,\" said Mr. Mellon. \\n\\nOut popped squiggly little bacteria tails.\\n\\n\"Or it could be a fungus,\" added Dr. Gourd. \\n\\nInstantly, Camilla was covered with different colored fungus blotches.\\n\\nThe Experts looked at Camilla, then at each other. \\n\\n\"We need to go over these numbers again back at the lab,\" Dr. Gourd explained. \\n\\n\"We’ll call you when we know something.\" \\n\\nBut the experts didn’t have a clue, much less a cure.\\n\\nBy now, the T.V. news had found out about Camilla. \\n\\nReporters from every channel were outside her house, telling the story of \"The Bizarre Case of the Incredible Changing Kid.\"\\n\\nSoon a huge crowd was camped out on the front lawn. \\n\\nThe Creams were swamped with all kinds of remedies from psychologists, allergists, herbalists, nutritionists, psychics, an old medicine man, a guru, and even a veterinarian. \\n\\nEach so-called cure only added to poor Camilla’s strange appearance until it was hard to even recognize her.\\n\\nShe sprouted roots and berries and crystals and feathers and a long furry tail.\\n\\nBut nothing worked.\\n\\nOne day, a woman who called herself an Environmental Therapist claimed she could cure Camilla. \\n\\n\"Close your eyes,\" she said. \\n\\n\"Breathe deeply, and become one with your room.\"\\n\\n\"I wish you hadn’t said that,\" Camilla groaned.\\n\\nSlowly, she started to melt into the walls of her room.\\n\\nHer bed became her mouth, her nose was a dresses, and two paintings were her eyes.\\n\\nThe therapist screamed and ran from the house. \\n\\n\"What are we going to do?\" cried Mrs. Cream.\\n\\n\"It just keeps getting worse and worse!\" She began to sob. \\n\\nAt that moment, Mr. Cream heard a quiet little knock at the front door.\\n\\nHe opened it, and there stood an old woman who was just as plump and sweet as a strawberry.\\n\\n\"Excuse me,\" she said brightly. \\n\\n\"But I think I can help.\"\\n\\nShe went into Camilla’s room and looked around. \\n\\n\"My goodness,\" she said with a shake of her head.\\n\\n\"What we have here is a bad case of stripes. \\n\\nOne of the worst I’ve ever seen!\"\\n\\nShe pulled a container of small green beans from her bag.\\n\\n\"Here,\" she said. \\n\\n\"These might do the trick.\"\\n\\n\"Are those magic beans?\" asked Mrs. Cream.\\n\\n\"Oh my, ho,\" replied the kind old woman. \\n\\n\"There’s no such thing. These are just plain old lima beans. \\n\\nI’ll bet you’d like some, wouldn’t you?\" she asked Camilla.\\n\\nCamilla wanted a big, heaping plateful of lima beans more than just about anything, but she was still afraid to admit it.\\n\\n\"Yuck!\" she said. \\n\\n\"No one likes lima beans, especially me!\"\\n\\n\"Oh, dear,\" the old woman said sadly. \\n\\n\"l guess I was wrong about you.\" \\n\\nShe put the beans back in her bag and started toward the door.\\n\\nCamilla watched the old woman walk away. \\n\\nThose beans would taste so good. \\n\\nAnd being laughed at for eating them was nothing, compared to what she’d been going through. \\n\\nShe finally couldn’t stand it.\\n\\n\"Wait!\" she cried. \\n\\n\"The truth is . . . I really love lima beans.\"\\n\\n\"l thought so,\" the old woman said with a smile. \\n\\nShe took a handful of beans and popped them into Camilla’s mouth.\\n\\n\"Mmmm,\" said Camilla.\\n\\nSuddenly the branches, feathers, and squiggly tails began to disappear.\\n\\nThen the whole room swirled around. \\n\\nWhen it stopped, there stood Camilla, and everything was back to normal.\\n\\n\"I’m cured!\" she shouted.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said the old woman. \\n\\n\"I knew the real you was in there somewhere.\" \\n\\nShe patted Camilla on the head. \\n\\nThen she went outside and vanished into the crowd.\\n\\nAfterward, Camilla wasn’t quite the same.\\n\\nSome of the kids at school said she was weird, but she didn’t care a bit.\\n\\nShe ate all the lima beans she wanted, and she never had even a touch of stripes again.

Swap thought that this would be an easy way to get part of the cellar dug for nothing, so he smiled in rather a mean way and gave the job of digging the cellar of the new town hall to Mike Mulligan and Mary Anne. \\n\\nThey started in early the next morning just as the sun was coming up. \\n\\nSoon a little boy came along.\\n\\n\"Do you think you will finish by sundown?\" he said to Mike Mulligan. \\n\\n\"Sure,\" said Mike, \"if you stay and watch us. \\n\\nWe always work faster and better when someone is watching us.\"\\n\\nSo the little boy stayed to watch.\\n\\nThen Mrs. McGillicuddy, Henry B. Swap, and the Town Constable came over to see what was happening, and they stayed to watch.\\n\\nMike Mulligan and Mary Anne dug a little faster and a little better. \\n\\nThis gave the little boy a good idea.\\n\\nHe ran off and told the postman with-the morning mail, the telegraph boy on his bicycle, the milkman with his cart and horse, the doctor on his way home, and the farmer and his family coming into town for the day, and they all stopped and stayed to watch.\\n\\nThat made Mike Mulligan and Mary Anne dig a little faster and a little better.\\n\\nThey finished the first corner neat and square. . .  but the sun was getting higher.\\n\\nClang! \\n\\nClang! \\n\\nClang!\\n\\nThe Fire Department arrived.\\n\\nThey had seen the smoke and thought there was a fire.\\n\\nThen the little boy said, \"Why don’t you stay and watch?\" \\n\\nSo the Fire Department of Popperville stayed to watch Mike Mulligan and Mary Anne.\\n\\nWhen they heard the fire engine, the children in the school across the street couldn’t keep their eyes on their lessons. \\n\\nThe teacher called a long recess and the whole school came out to watch.\\n\\nThat made Mike Mulligan and Mary Anne dig still faster and still better.\\n\\nThey finished the second corner neat and square, but the sun was right up in the top of the sky. \\n\\nNow the girl who answers the telephone called up the next towns of Bangerville and Bopperville and Kipperville and Kopperville and told them what was happening in Popperville.\\n\\nAll the people came over to see if Mike Mulligan and his steam shovel could dig the cellar in just one day. \\n\\nThe more people came, the faster Mike Mulligan and Mary Anne dug. \\n\\nBut they would have to hurry.\\n\\nThey were only halfway and the sun was beginning to go down.\\n\\nThey finished the third corner. . .  neat and square.\\n\\nNever had Mike Mulligan and Mary Anne had so many people to watch them; never had they dug so fast and so well; and never, had the sun seemed to go down so fast.\\n\\n\"Hurry, Mike Mulligan! Hurry! Hurry!’ shouted the little boy.\\n\\n\"There’s not much more time!\"\\n\\nDirt was flying everywhere, and the smoke and steam were so thick that the people could hardly see anything.\\n\\nBut listen!\\n\\nBing! \\n\\nBang! \\n\\nCrash! \\n\\nSlam!\\n\\nFaster and faster.\\n\\nThen suddenly it was quiet.\\n\\nSlowly the dirt settled down.\\n\\nThe smoke and steam cleared away, and there was the cellar all finished.\\n\\nFour corners. . .  neat and square; four walls. . .  straight down, and Mike Mulligan and Mary Anne at the bottom, and the sun was just going down behind the hill.\\n\\n\"Hurray!\" shouted the people. \\n\\n\"Hurray for Mike Mulligan and his steam shovel! \\n\\nThey have dug the cellar in just one day.\"\\n\\nSuddenly the little boy said, \"How are they going to get out?\"\\n\\n\"That’s right,\" said Ms. McGillicuddy to Henry B. Swap.\\n\\n\"How is he going to het his steam shovel out?\"\\n\\nHenry B. Swap didn’t answer, but he smiled in rather a mean way.\\n\\nThen everybody said, \"How are they going to get out? \\n\\n\"Hi!\\n\\n Mike Mulligan! \\n\\nHow are you going to get your steam shovel out?\"\\n\\nMike Mulligan looked around at the four square walls and four square corners, and he said, \"We’ve dug so fast and we’ve dug so well that we’ve quite forgotten to leave a way out!\"\\n\\nNothing like this had ever happened to Mike Mulligan and Mary Anne before and they didn’t know what to do. \\n\\nNothing like this had ever happened before in Popperville.\\n\\nEverybody started talking at once, and everybody had a different idea, and everybody thought that his idea was the best.\\n\\nThey talked and they talked and they argued and they fought till they were worn out, and still no one knew how to get Mike Mulligan and Mary Anne out of the cellar they had dug. \\n\\nThen Henry B. Swap said, \"The job isn’t finished because Mary Anne isn’t out of the cellar, so Mike Mulligan won’t get paid.\"\\n\\nAnd he smiled again in a rather mean way.\\n\\nNow the little boy, who had been keeping very quiet, had another good idea.\\n\\nHe said, \"why couldn’t we leave Mary Anne in the cellar and build the new town hall above her? \\n\\nLet her be the furnace for the new town hall and let Mike Mulligan be the janitor. \\n\\nThen you wouldn’t have to buy a new furnace, and we could pay Mike Mulligan for digging the cellar in just one day.\"\\n\\n\"Why not?\" said Henry B. Swap, and smiled in a way that was not quite so mean.\\n\\n\"Why not?\" said the Town Constable.\\n\\n\"Why not?\" said all the people.\\n\\nSo they found a ladder and climbed down into the cellar to ask Mike Mulligan and Mary Anne. \\n\\n\"Why not?\" said Mike Mulligan.\\n\\nSo it was decided, and everybody was happy. \\n\\nThey built the new town hall right over Mike Mulligan and Mary Anne.\\n\\nIt was finished before winter.\\n\\nEvery day the little boy goes over to see Mike Mulligan and Mary Anne and Mrs. McGillicuddv takes him nice hot apple pies. \\n\\nAs for Henry B. Swap, he spends most of his time in the cellar of the new town hall listening to the stories that Mike Mulligan has to tell and smiling in a way that isn’t mean at all.\\n\\nNow when you go to Popperville, be sure to go down in the cellar of the new town hall.\\n\\nThere they’ll be, Mike Mulligan and Mary Anne. . .  \\n\\nMike in his rocking chair smoking his pipe, and Mary Anne beside him warming up his meetings in the new town hall.

buses!\\n\\nHowever, he is especially interested in two gentlemen he notices on the street.\\n\\nHe says to himself: \"Really, they are very well dressed.\\n\\nI would like to have some fine clothes, too!\\n\\nI wonder how I can get them?\"\\n\\nLuckily, a very rich Old Lady who has always been fond of little elephants understands right away that he is longing for a fine suit.\\n\\nAs she likes to make people happy, she gives him her purse.\\n\\nBabar says to her politely: \"Thank you, Madam.\"\\n\\nWithout wasting any time, Babar goes into a big store.\\n\\nHe enters the elevator.\\n\\nIt is such fun to ride up and down in this funny box, that he rides all the way up ten times and all the way down ten times.\\n\\nHe did not want to stop but the elevator boy finally said to him: \"This is not a toy, Mr. Elephant.\\n\\nYou must get out and do your shopping.\\n\\nLook, here is the floorwalker.\"\\n\\nBabar then buys himself: a shirt with a collar and a tie, a suit of a becoming shade of green, then a handsome derby hat, and also shoes with spats. \\n\\nWell satisfied with his purchases and feeling elegant indeed, Babar now goes to the photographer to have his picture taken.\\n\\nAnd here is his photograph.\\n\\nBabar dines with his friend the Old Lady.\\n\\nShe thinks he looks very smart in his new clothes.\\n\\nAfter dinner, because he is tired, he goes to bed and falls asleep

great forest with his little cousins and his friends, the monkeys.\\n\\nHe often stands at the window, thinking sadly of his childhood, and cries when he remembers his mother.\\n\\nTwo years have passed.\\n\\none day during his walk he sees two little elephants coming toward him.\\n\\nThey have no clothes on.\\n\\n\"Why,\" he says in astonishment to the Old Lady, \"it’s Arthur and Celeste, my little cousins!\"\\n\\nBabar kisses them affectionately and hurries off with them to buy them some fine clothes.\\n\\nHe takes them to a pastry shop to eat some good cakes.\\n\\nMeanwhile, in the forest, the elephants are searching high and low for Arthur and Celeste, and their mothers are worried.\\n\\nFortunately, in flying over the town, an old marabou bird has seen them and comes back quickly to tell the news.\\n\\nThe mothers of Arthur and Celeste have come to the town to fetch them back but they scold them just the same because they ran away.\\n\\nBabar makes up his mind to go back with Arthur and Celeste and their mothers to see the great forest again,\\n\\nThe Old Lady helps him to pack his trunk.\\n\\nThey are all ready to start.\\n\\nBabar kisses the Old Lady

the car for the mothers, so they run behind, and lift up their trunks to avoid breathing the dust.\\n\\nThe Old Lady is left alone.\\n\\nSadly she wonders: \"When shall I see my little Babar again?\"\\n\\nAlas, that very day, the King of the elephants had eaten a bad mushroom.\\n\\nIt poisoned him and he became ill, so ill that he died.\\n\\nThis was a great calmity.\\n\\nAfter the funeral the oldest elephants were holding a meeting to choose a new king.\\n\\nJust then they hear a noise.\\n\\nThey turn around.\\n\\nGuess what they see!\\n\\nBabar arriving in his car and all the

Cornelius, the oldest of all the elephants, spoke in his quavering voice: \"My good friends we are seeking a King.\\n\\nWhy not choose Babar?\\n\\nHe has just returned from the big city, he has learned so much among living men. \\n\\nLet us crown him King.\"\\n\\nAll the other elephants thought that Cornelius had spoken wisely and eagerly await Babar’s reply.\\n\\n\"I want to thank you one and all,\" said Babar, \"but before accepting your proposal, I must explain to you that, while traveling in the car, Celeste and I became engaged.\\n\\nIf I become your King, she will be your Queen.\"\\n\\n\"Long live Queen Celeste!\"\\n\\n\"Long live King Babar!\", cry all the elephants without a moment’s hesitation.\\n\\nAnd thus it was that Babar became King.\\n\\n\"You have good ideas,\" said Babar to Cornelius.\\n\\n\"I will therefore make you a general, and when I get my crown, I will give you my hat.\\n\\nIn a week I shall marry Celeste.\\n\\nWe will have a spendid party

he was put in a pie by Mrs. McGregor.\"\\n\\n\"Now run along, and don’t get into mischief.\\n\\nI am going out.\"\\n\\nThen old Mrs. Rabbit took a basket and her umbrella, and went through the wood to the baker’s.\\n\\nShe bought a loaf of brown bread and five currant buns.\\n\\nFlopsy, Mopsy, and Cottontail, who were good little bunnies, went down the lane to gather blackberries.\\n\\nBut Peter, who was very naughty, ran straight away to Mr. McGregor’s garden, and squeezed under the gate!\\n\\nFirst he ate some lettuces and some French beans; and then he ate some radishes; and then, feeling rather sick, he went to look for some parsley.\\n\\nBut round the end of a cucumber frame, whom should be meet but Mr. McGregor!\\n\\nMr. McGregor was on his hands and knees planting out young cabbages, but he jumped up and ran after Peter, waving a rake and calling out, \"Stop thief!\"\\n\\nPeter was most dreadfully frightened; he rushed all over the garden, for he had forgotten the way back to the gate.\\n\\nHe lost one of his shoes among the cabbages, and the other shoe amongst the potatoes.\\n\\nAfter losing them, he ran on four legs and went faster, so that I think he might have got away altogether if he had not unfortunately run into a gooseberry net, and got caught by the large buttons on his jacket.\\n\\nIt was a blue jacket with brass buttons, quite new.\\n\\nPeter gave himself up for lost, and shed big tears; but his sobs were overheard by some friendly sparrows, who flew to him in great excitement, and implored him to exert himself.\\n\\nMr. McGregor came up with a sieve, which he intended to pop upon the top of Peter; but Peter wriggled out just in time, leaving his jacket behind him, and rushed into the toolshed, and jumped into a can.\\n\\nIt would have been a beautiful thing to hide in, if it had not had so much water in it.\\n\\nMr. McGregor was quite sure that Peter was somewhere in the toolshed, perhaps hidden underneath a flowerpot.\\n\\nHe began to turn them over carefully, looking under each.\\n\\nPresently Peter sneezed – \"Kertyschoo!\"\\n\\nMr. McGregor was after him in no time, and tried to put his foot upon Peter, who jumped out of a window, upsetting three plants.\\n\\nThe window was too small for Mr. McGregor, and he was tired of running after Peter.\\n\\nHe went back to his work.\\n\\nPeter sat down to rest.\\n\\nHe was out of breath and trembling with fright, and he had no the least idea which way to go.\\n\\nAlso, he was very damp with sitting in that can.\\n\\nAfter a time began to wander about, going lippity – lippity – not very fast, and looking all around.\\n\\nHe found a door in a wall; but it was locked, and there was no room for a fat little rabbit to squeeze underneath.\\n\\nAn old mouse was running in and out over the stone doorstep, carrying peas and beans to her family in the wood.\\n\\nPeter asked her the way to the gate, but she had such a large pea in her mouth that she could not answer.\\n\\nShe only shook her head at him.\\n\\nPeter began to cry.\\n\\nThen he tried to find his way straight across the garden, but he became more and more puzzled.\\n\\nPresently, he came to a pond where Mr. McGregor filled his water cans.\\n\\nA white cat was staring at some goldfish; she sat very, very still, but now and then the tip of her tail twitched as if it were alive.\\n\\nPeter thought it best to go away without speaking to her; he had heard about cats from his cousin, little Benjamin Bunny.\\n\\nHe went back towards the toolshed, but suddenly, quite close to him, he heard the noise of a hoe – scr-r-ritch, scratch, scratch, scritch.\\n\\nPeter scuttered underneath the bushes.\\n\\nBut presently, as nothing happened, he came out, and climbed upon a wheelbarrow, and peeped over.\\n\\nThe first thing he saw was Mr. McGregor hoeing his onions.\\n\\nHis back was turned towards Peter, and beyond him was the gate.\\n\\nPeter got down very quietly off the wheelbarrow, and started running as fast as he could go, along a straight walk behind some black-currant bushes.\\n\\nMr. McGregor caught sight of him at the corner, but Peter did not care.\\n\\nHe slipped underneath the gate, and was safe at last in the wood outside the garden.\\n\\nMr. McGregor hung up the little jacket and the shoes for a scarecrow to frighten blackbirds.\\n\\nPeter never stopped running or looked behind him till he got home to the big fir tree.\\n\\nHe was so tired that he flopped down upon the nice soft sand on the floor of the rabbit hole, and shut his eyes.\\n\\nHis mother was busy cooking;

\\n\\nGeorge stopped working and pressed his nose against the window.  \\n\\nTwo painters were working inside.\\n\\nGeorge was fascinated.\\n\\nPainting looked like a lot more fun than washing windows!\\n\\nThe painters were ready to go out for lunch.\\n\\nThe minute they left George climbed inside.\\n\\nWhat wonderful paints and brushes they had! \\n\\nGeorge could not resist. . . \\n\\nAn hour later the painters came back.\\n\\nThey opened the door- and stood with their mouths wide open.\\n\\nThe whole room had changed to a jungle with palm trees all over the walls and a giraffe and two leopards and a zebra.  \\n\\nAnd a little monkey was busy painting himself on one of the trees!\\n\\nThen the painters knew what had happened!\\n\\nLuckily George was close to a door.\\n\\nHe ran out as fast as he could. \\n\\nAfter him ran the two painters, then the elevator man and then the woman who lived in the place.\\n\\n\"Oh, my lovely room, my lovely room!\" cried the woman.\\n\\n\"Don’t let him her away!\"\\n\\nGeorge headed for the fire escape.\\n\\nGeorge reached the end of the fire escape.  \\n\\nThe others had not caught up with him yet.\\n\\nHere was his chance.\\n\\nThey could not jump!\\n\\nBut George could easily jump down and escape.\\n\\nIn a moment he would be safe!\\n\\nPoor little George!\\n\\nHe had forgotten that the pavement was hard as stone. . .  not like the soft grass of the jungle.\\n\\nToo bad!\\n\\nThe fall broke his leg and an ambulance came to take George to the hospital.\\n\\n\"He got what he deserved!\" said the woman \"making my apartment into a jungle, indeed!\"\\n\\n\"I told him he would get into trouble,\" the elevator man added.\\n\\n\"He was too curious.\"\\n\\nGeorge had to lie in bed with his leg high up in a plaster cast.\\n\\nHe was very unhappy.\\n\\nAnd it had all started out so nicely!\\n\\nIf only he had not been so curious he could have had a lot of fun.\\n\\nNow it was too late. . . \\n\\nBut the next morning George’s friend, the man with the big yellow hat, was buying a newspaper. \\n\\nSuddenly he got very excited.\\n\\n\"This is George!\" he shouted when he saw the picture on the front page.\\n\\nQuickly he read the whole story and then ran to a telephone booth to ring a hospital.\\n\\n\"I am George’s friend,\" he said to the nurse who answered the telephone.\\n\\n\"Please take good care of him so that he will get better quickly.\\n\\nI want to take him to a movie studio and make a picture about his life in the jungle.\\n\\nDon’t let him get into any more mischief until I can take him away.\"\\n\\nFinally the day came when George could walk again.\\n\\n\"Your friend is going to take you away this morning said the nurse.\\n\\n\"Just wait right here for him and don’t touch anything!\"\\n\\nAs soon as George was alone he looked around at the strange hospital things.\\n\\nI wonder what is in that big blue bottle, \" he thought.\\n\\nAnd this is how the man with the yellow hat found George when he came to call for him!\\n\\nThey picked him up and shook him but they could not wake him up.\\n\\nHe was so fast asleep that finally they had to put him UNDER THE SHOWER!\\n\\nHow surprised his was when he woke up!\\n\\nGeorge said goodbye to the nurse and the kind doctor,\\n\\nThen he and the man with the yellow hat got into the car to drive to the movie studio.\\n\\nIn the president’s office George had to sign a contract. \\n\\nNow he was a movie actor!\\n\\nIn the studio George was kept so busy all the time that he forgot to be curious,\\n\\nHe liked the jungle they made for him and played happily there.\\n\\nAnd when the movie was finally finished George invited all his friends to see it: the doctor and the nurse and the ambulance driver and the man from the newstand and the woman and the elevator man and the two painters and the cook and the reporter and all the keepers of the Zoo.\\n\\nNow the lights went out and the picture started.\\n\\n\"This is George,\" the voice began.\\n\\n\"He lived in the jungle.\\n\\nHe was a good little monkey- he had only one fault: he was too curious.\"\\n\\nThe End.',\n",

\\n\\nI gotta! \\n\\nI gotta! \\n\\nI gotta!\"\\n\\nMama saw that I-gotta-have-it look in Sister’s eyes.\\n\\nShe took her aside and reminded her about all the wonderful presents she had gotten on her last birthday. \\n\\nBut Sister didn’t hear a word Mama said.\\n\\nShe just stared at that big, beautiful bike with the hand brake and the super-sport wheels. \\n\\n\"Oh, dear,\" said Mama. \\n\\n\"I think you’ve been taken over by the green-eyed monster.\"\\n\\n\"Green-eyed monster?\" said Sister.\\n\\n\"What’s that?\"\\n\\n\"Oh,\" said Mama.\\n\\n\"That’s just a way folks have of talking about jealousy and envy.\\n\\nYou know what it means to be jealous.\\n\\nEnvy is when you want something that belongs to somebody else.\"\\n\\n\"But, Mama,\" said Sister.\\n\\n\"It’s such a great beautiful bike!\"\\n\\n\"Please listen to me, Sister,\" said Mama.\\n\\n\"Even if you had a bike like that, you couldn’t ride it.\\n\\nYou’re not big enough.\\n\\nYour feet wouldn’t reach the pedals.\\n\\nBesides, look what Papa’s got for you.\"\\n\\nPapa was wheeling in Brother’s junior-size bike with its training wheels attached.\\n\\n\"It’s yours now,\" he said.\\n\\nSister looked at the bike Brother had outgrown.\\n\\nIt was okay, but it didn’t have a hand brake, three speeds, and super-sport wheels.\\n\\n\"Come on now,\" said Mama. \\n\\n\"Our guests are leaving. \\n\\nIt’s time to say good-bye.\"\\n\\n\"Good-bye!\" said Brother. \\n\\n\"Thank you all for the wonderful presents!\"\\n\\n\"Bye,\" said Sister. \\n\\nGramps and Gran got into their pickup truck and headed for home. \\n\\nLizzy Bruin got into her dad’s car with the others. \\n\\nMr. Bruin had agreed to come for them and drive them home. \\n\\nThen papa helped carry the new bike down the front steps. \\n\\nMama and papa watched proudly as Brother climbed on and tried it out.\\n\\nFirst Brother rode big, fast circles around the tree house. \\n\\nThen he did a few wheelies. \\n\\nWhen he started riding with his feet up on the handlebars, Mama got worried.\\n\\n\"Now let’s not be reckless!\" she said.\\n\\nSister watched, too. \\n\\nShe had gone inside and was watching from a window. \\n\\nAs she did so she became filled with envy. \\n\\nFrom the tips of her pink hair bow down to the tips of her toenails, Sister really wanted that big, beautiful racing bike.\\n\\nThat night Sister was having trouble falling asleep because she was still thinking about the bike. \\n\\nThen just as her eyes were closing the strangest thing happened. \\n\\nShe had a visitor. \\n\\nThe visitor looked exactly like Sister, except she was green and had little horns on her head. \\n\\n\"I know who you are,\" Sister said. \\n\\n\"You’re the green-eyed monster.\"\\n\\nSister was having a dream, of course.\\n\\nBut she didn’t know that.\\n\\nThat’s the thing about dreams.\\n\\nThey’re so real.\\n\\n\"Come,\" said the green-eyed monster.\\n\\n\"If you want a bike like Brother’s, all you have to do is prove you’re big enough to ride it.\"\\n\\nBefore she quite knew what was happening, she was up on the bike and the green-eyed monster was giving her a big push.\\n\\nThe bike was much too big for her.\\n\\nHer feet couldn’t even almost reach the pedals.\\n\\nThen, as so often happens in dreams, things began to change.\\n\\nThe bike got bigger and bigger and BIGGER!\\n\\nNow Sister was speeding down a hill.\\n\\nAt the bottom was a great rock. \\n\\nShe smashed into it. \\n\\nThere was a huge crash!\\n\\nBrother’s beautiful new birthday bike flew into a thousand pieces. \\n\\n\"What have I done?\" she screamed. \\n\\n\"What have I done?\"\\n\\nMama and Papa, who had just fallen asleep, came running into the cubs’ room. \\n\\n\"Oh, Mama!\" cried Sister.\\n\\n\"I just smashed Brother’s beautiful birthday bike into a thousand pieces! \\n\\nA thousand pieces!\"\\n\\n\"Try to calm down, sweetie,\" said Mama.\\n\\n\"Brother’s bike is perfectly safe. \\n\\nYou were having a dream.\"\\n\\n\"What’s going on?\" said Brother, rubbing his eyes.\\n\\n\"I’ll go downstairs and get us all some warm milk,\" said Papa. \\n\\n\"It’ll help us get back to sleep.\"\\n\\nAnd it did.\\n\\nThe next day Sister’s best friend, Lizzy, came over to play.\\n\\nShe and Sister had a fun time riding around the yard.\\n\\nBrother’s old bike turned out to be just right for Sister.\\n\\nLizzy had a good time on Sister’s old trike.\\n\\nAnd Brother rode circles around them on his birthday bike. \\n\\nLater, when Mr. Bruin came over to pick up Lizzy, he had a very big surprise for everybody. \\n\\nHe had just traded in his old car for a beautiful brand-new one.\\n\\nAnd what a car it was! \\n\\nIt had wire wheels, leather seats, and racing stripes.\\n\\nMama, Brother, Sister, and Lizzy congratulated Mr. Bruin on his fine new car.\\n\\nBut not Papa.\\n\\nHe just stood and stared.\\n\\nHe had the same I-gotta-have-it look that Sister had when she first saw Brother’s new bike.\\n\\n\"Papa,\" said Sister.\\n\\n\"I think you better watch out for ‘you know who’!\"\\n\\nPapa did know who.\\n\\n\"Mr. Bruin,\" he said, \"congratulations on a fine new car!\"\\n\\nAfter the Bruins drove away, Mama and Papa sat on the tree house steps and watched Brother and Sister do some plain and fancy bike riding.',\n",

Where?\" He looked and looked.\\n\\nHe could see nothing there but a small speck of dust blowing past through the air.\\n\\n\"I say!\" murmured Horton.\\n\\n\"I’ve never heard tell of a small speck of dust that is able to yell.\\n\\nSo you know what I think? . . .  \\n\\nWhy, I think that there must be someone on top of that small speck of dust!\\n\\nSome sort of a creature of very small size, too small to be seen by an elephant’s eyes. . .  some poor little person who’s shaking with fear that he’ll blow in the pool!\\n\\nHe has no way to steer!\\n\\nI’ll just have to save him.\\n\\nBecause, after all, a person’s a person, no matter how small.\"\\n\\nSo, gently, and using the greatest of care, The elephant stretched his great trunk through the air, and he lifted the dust speck and carried it over and placed it down, safe, on a very soft clover.\\n\\n\"Humpf!\" humpfed a voice.  \\n\\n‘Twas a sour kangaroo.\\n\\nAnd the young kangaroo in her pouch said \"Humpf!\" too.\\n\\n\"Why, that speck is as small as the head of a pin.\\n\\nA person on that?\\n\\nWhy, there never has been!\"\\n\\n\"Believe me,\" said Horton.\\n\\n\"I tell you sincerely, my ears are quite keen and I heard him quite clearly.\\n\\nI know there’s a person down there.\\n\\nAnd, what’s more, quite likely there’s two.\\n\\nEven three.\\n\\nEven four.\\n\\nQuite likely. . .  a family, for all that we know!\\n\\nA family with children just starting to grow.\\n\\nSo, please,\" Horton said, \"as a favor to me, try not to disturb them.\\n\\nJust please let them be.\"\\n\\n\"I think you’re a fool!\" laughed the sour kangaroo and the young kangaroo in her pouch said, \"Me, too!\\n\\nYou’re the biggest blame fool in the Jungle of Nool!\"\\n\\nAnd the kangaroos plunged in the cool of the pool. \\n\\n\"What terrible splashing!\" the elephant frowned.\\n\\n\"I can’t let my very small persons get drowned!\\n\\nI’ve got to protect them. \\n\\nI’m bigger than they.\"\\n\\nSo he plucked up the clover and hustled away.\\n\\nThrough the high jungle tree tops, the news quickly spread: \\n\\n\"He talks to a dust speck!\\n\\nHe’s out of his head!\\n\\nJust look at him walk with that speck on that flower!\"\\n\\nAnd Horton walked, worrying, almost an hour.\\n\\n\"Should I put this speck down?. . . \" Horton thought with alarm.\\n\\n\"If I do, these small persons may come to great harm.\\n\\nI can’t put it down.\\n\\nAnd I won’t!\\n\\nAfter all a person’s a person.\\n\\nNo matter how small.\"\\n\\nThen Horton stopped walking.\\n\\nThe speck-voice was talking!\\n\\nThe voice was so faint he could just barely hear it.\\n\\n\"Speak up, please,\" said Horton. \\n\\nHe put his ear near it.\\n\\n\"My friend,\" came the voice, \"you’re a very fine friend.\\n\\nYou’ve helped all us folks on this dust speck no end.\\n\\nYou’ve saved all our houses, our ceilings and floors.\\n\\nYou’ve saved all our churches and grocery stores.’’\\n\\n\"You mean. . . \" Horton gasped, \"you have buildings there, too?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes,\" piped the voice. \"We most certainly do.\"\\n\\n\"I know,\" called the voice, \"I’m too small to be seen but I’m Mayor of a town that is friendly and clean.\\n\\nOur buildings, to you, would seem terribly small but to us, who aren’t big, they are wonderfully tall.\\n\\nMy town is called Who-ville, for I am a who and we whos are all thankful and grateful to you.\"\\n\\nAnd Horton called back to the Mayor of the town, \"You’re safe now.\\n\\nDon’t worry.\\n\\nI won’t let you down.\"\\n\\nBut, just as he spoke to the Mayor of the speck, three big jungle monkeys climbed up Horton’s neck!\\n\\nThe Wickersham brothers came shouting, \"What rot!\\n\\nThis elephant’s talking to Whos who are not!\\n\\nThere aren’t any Whos!\\n\\nAnd they don’t have a Mayor!\\n\\nAnd we’re going to stop all this nonsense!

so much bread and jam?\" asked Frances.\\n\\nI don’t think that will happen for quite a while,\" said Mother.\\n\\n\"So eat it all up and enjoy it.\"\\n\\nFrances ate up most of her bread and jam, but

Arnie,\" Mr. Bing stammered.\\n\\nIt’s nice to eat you – I mean meet you.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Bing, would you be a dear and allow me to use your telephone?\"\\n\\nArnie asked extra politely.\\n\\n\"Oh . . . well . . . okay,\" said Mr. Bing, and he handed Arnie the phone.\\n\\nAs quickly as he could, Arnie dialed the number of the bakery.\\n\\n(still shocked to actually be talking to a doughnut!)\\n\\nThe baker answered the phone.\\n\\n\"Downtown Bakery, home of the best\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Baker Man!\" Arnie frantically whispered.\\n\\n\"This is Arnie the doughnut.\\n\\nDo you remember me?\\n\\nYou made me at 5:15 this morning, and I was bought about twenty minutes ago by a man who goes by the name of Br. Bing.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Arnie,\" the baker answered.\\n\\n‘What can I do for you?\"\\n\\n\"Now, I don’t want to alarm you, but just moments ago, that man tried to eat me!\\n\\nAnd not only that – he claims to have eaten hundreds of us!\\n\\nI’m going to make a run for it, but I wanted to warn you so that if you see him coming into the bakery again, you can stop him!\"\\n\\n\"Oh my, Arnie-I thought you understood.\\n\\nThat’s why I make doughnuts . . . for people to eat.\"\\n\\n\"I CAN’T BELIEVE IT!\" Arnie gasped.\\n\\n\"Are the other doughnuts aware of this arrangement?\"\\n\\n\"well, I think so,\" the baker said.\\n\\n\"Let me ask them to make sure.\"\\n\\nShowing signs of doughnut shock\\n\\nPopped-up eyebrow sprinkles\\n\\nBugged-out eyeballs\\n\\nOverall dazed expression\\n\\nSevere sprinkle loss\\n\\nWeak in the knees\\n\\nFeels like someone punched a hole right through him\\n\\nThe baker yelled to the other doughnuts, \"DO YOU DOUGHNUTS KNOW THAT YOU’RE GOING TO BE EATEN?\"\\n\\n\"YES, we know!\" the doughnuts shouted back.\\n\\n\"We’re DELICIOUS!\"\\n\\nWe’re very popular!\\n\\nPeople love us!\\n\\nC’est magnifique\\n\\nTry us for yourself!\\n\\nIs he going a little kooky?\\n\\nKooky or cookie?\\n\\n\"Did you hear that Arnie?\" the baker asked.\\n\\nArnie was crushed.\\n\\nThe phone dropped from his hand.\\n\\nHe’d heard all he needed to hear.\\n\\nArnie forgot all about his plan to escape.\\n\\nHe collapsed back onto the plate, glanced up at Mr. Bing, and muttered, \"All right then, let’s get this over with.\\n\\nGo ahead and eat me.\"\\n\\nMr. Bing gazed down at Arnie.  \"I’m not going to eat you, Arnie,\" he said reassuringly.\\n\\n\"I just wouldn’t feel right about it now.\"\\n\\n\"REALLY?\" Arnie said, with a huge sigh of relief.\\n\\n\"Well, I’m glad to see that you’ve come to your senses!\"\\n\\n\"But since I’m not going to eat you,\" Mr. Bing continues, \"I’ll have to figure our something else to do with you.\\n\\nI paid good money for you – I don’t want to be wasteful.\"\\n\\n\"Of course not!\" Arnie agreed.\\n\\n\"What we need to do is each make a list of things I can do with you instead of eating you.\\n\\nBetween the two of us, I know we’ll come up with something.\"\\n\\n\"Good plan, Mr. Bing!\" Arnie said.\\n\\n\"This will be a breeze-I bet I’m good at lots of stuff!\"\\n\\nThey both feverishly wrote down their ideas.\\n\\nWhen they were finished, Mr. Bing asked, \"Would you like to read yours first?\"\\n\\n\"Sure thing, Mr. Bing!\" Arnie answered.\\n\\n\"Things Mr. Bing can do with me instead of eating me\"\\n\\n\"Do you need a ballroom dance partner?\"\\n\\n\"No, I don’t dance.\"\\n\\n\"You could use a personal fitness trainer.\"\\n\\nDrop and give me 20!\\n\\n\"Hmmmmm, I’d get too sweaty.\"\\n\\n\"How about a portrait painter?\"\\n\\n\"oh, heavens no!\"\\n\\n\"Would you like me to entertain at your parties?\"\\n\\nI wonder if he does weddings.\\n\\nDoughnut make my brown eyes bluuuue . . .\\n\\nHe’s fabulous!\\n\\nWherever did you find him?\\n\\n\"I don’t like throwing parties.\"\\n\\n\"I could be your chauffeur.\"\\n\\nLook out for that tree!\\n\\nRelax.\\n\\n\"But you can’t see over the steering wheel.\"\\n\\n\"I’d make a great bodyguard!\"\\n\\n\"Who could you protect me from – a cookie?\"\\n\\nThat’s close enough, Ma’am.\\n\\n\"All righty, Mr. Bing.\\n\\nLet’s hear what you came up with!\"\\n\\n\"Okey-dokey,\" he replied.\\n\\n\"I just know you’ll like some of these.\"\\n\\n\"Things I can do with Arnie instead of eating him\"\\n\\n\"I could use you as a pincushion.\"\\n\\nOuch!\\n\\n\"Ooooh, too painful.\"\\n\\n\"How about an air freshener for my car?\"\\n\\nHi Arnie – you smell good enough to eat!\\n\\n\"How about not?\"\\n\\n\"Would you like to be a picture frame?\"\\n\\n\"I don’t imagine so.\"\\n\\n\"I need a new bowling ball.\"\\n\\n\"Well, don’t look at me!\"\\n\\nYea, Arnie!\\n\\n\"You’d make a fine paperweight.\\n\\nKeep up the good work, Arnie!\\n\\n\"BORING!\"\\n\\n\"Hat about a doorstop?\"\\n\\nThanks, Arnie!\\n\\n\"Try again.\"\\n\\nBut there was nothing else on Mr. Bing’s list.\\n\\nThey were both completely out of ideas.\\n\\nArnie and Mr. Bing were exhausted.  \\n\\nThey felt terribly disappointed.\\n\\nAfter a few minutes of awkward silence, Mr. Bing finally spoke.\\n\\n\"I’m sorry, Arnie- but it’s clear that we can’t agree on anything for you to do around here.\\n\\nThis is difficult for me to say, but I think it would be best if you found another home.\"\\n\\n\"I know,\" said Arnie, fighting back tears.\\n\\n\"I’ll just be on my way then.\\n\\nIs it all right if I keep this napkin to pack up all my loose sprinkles?\\n\\n\"Of course,\" Mr. Bing replied sadly.\\n\\n\"As soon as I get a job, I’ll pay you back the money you spent on me.\"\\n\\n\"That’s not necessary, Arnie.\"\\n\\nGood-bye Arnie- we’ve got some lovely parting gifts for you.\\n\\nArnie shook Mr. Bing’s hand and thanked him for his kindness.\\n\\nMr. Bing opened the door, and as Arnie left he paused and said, \"I guess doughnuts really are only good for eating, aren’t they?\"\\n\\nThey both waved good-bye and Arnie was gone.\\n\\nMr. Bing stood at the window and watched as Arnie walked away.\\n\\nHe walked past the flower beds, the mailboxes, and the apartment manager’s office.\\n\\nYou can have my limited-time offer for an interest-free credit card.\\n\\nNo mail for me.\\n\\nOffice\\n\\nNow leasing\\n\\nIs there anything worse than a sad pastry?\\n\\nRemember how happy I was at the beginning of the story?\\n\\nI can’t read, but you sure looked happy.\\n\\nHe passed the tennis court, the swimming pool, and the clubhouse.\\n\\nBut when Arnie reached the NO DOGS ALLOWED sign at the end of the driveway, Mr. Bing suddenly came up with a new idea.\\n\\nOopsie!\\n\\nSometimes life feels like a big bonk on the head.\\n\\nTechnically, I’m food - so I guess a quick dip in the pool is out.\\n\\nNo food in pool area.\\n\\nIs that a doughnut?\\n\\nYeah, whatever, anyway, about my trip abroad. . .\\n\\nNo dogs allowed\\n\\nBye, Arnie\\n\\n(the fastest Mr. Bing’s moved in years)\\n\\n\"Arnie!\\n\\nArnie!\\n\\nWait up!\" yelled Mr. Bing as he ran after him.\\n\\nArnie turned back and stopped.\\n\\nWhen Mr. Bing caught up with him, he was out of breath.\\n\\n\"I can’t believe I didn’t think of this earlier!\" Mr. Bing panted.\\n\\n\"Arnie, I’ve always wanted a dog and could never have one because they’re not allowed here.\\n\\nBut there’s no sign that says: NO DOUGHNUTS ALLOWED.\"\\n\\nArnie perked up when he realized that Mr. Bing was thinking.\\n\\nKeep talkin’ big guy.\\n\\nNO DOGS ALLOWED\\n\\nWould you like to take walks and play fetch?\" Mr. Bing asked excitedly.\\n\\n\"You bet I would!\"\\n\\n\"Can you do tricks, like rolling over?\"\\n\\n\"Rolling over?\\n\\nLOOK AT ME- I was MADE For rolling over!\"\\n\\n\"Well, then, there’s only one thing left to ask.\\n\\nArnie, will you be my doughnut-dog?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, Mr. Bing- I would LOVE to be your doughnut-dog!\"\\n\\nIt’s a WACKY idea, but it just might work!\\n\\nFrom that moment on, Arnie and Mr. Bing were inseparable.\\n\\nArnie liked being a doughnut-dog even better than he liked being a doughnot.\\n\\nGet it, Arnie!\\n\\nTake pine.\\n\\nPet groomers\\n\\nBye Arnie!\\n\\nBuy Mr. Bing!\\n\\nI got the DELUXE package!\\n\\nHe went through a short phase of chewing on furniture and barking at the mailman, but after a crash course in obedience school, he graduated first in his class.\\n\\nEverywhere the two of them went, people would stop to pet Arnie.\\n\\nNo one had ever seen a doughnut-dog before.\\n\\nCongratulations Arnie!\\n\\nIs that a doughnut-dog?\\n\\nWhat a darling man.\\n\\nWhat a darling dog!\\n\\nYou’re so sticky, yes you are.\\n\\nI love that Arnie.\\n\\nGot a napkin?\\n\\nArnie and Mr. Bing had so much fun together.\\n\\nArnie was the best pet Mr. Bing could ever have hoped for – and Mr. Bing was Arnie’s best friend.\\n\\nBeware of Doughnut.',\n",

       " 'Title: Train\\n\\nAuthor: Elisha Cooper\\n\\nThe train leaves in minutes. \\n\\nPassengers buy tickets and rush across the floor to where the train is humming on its tracks.\\n\\nConductors look up the platform. \\n\\nThey check their watches.\\n\\nOne minute. Hats wave, whistles blow. \\n\\n\"All aboard!\" Not all.\\n\\nA passenger jumps on at the last second. \\n\\nThe doors whoosh shut.\\n\\nThe train pulls out of the station . . ..  and out of the city. \\n\\nThe train is a red-striped Commuter Train. \\n\\nThe conductor swings down the aisle, shouts, \"Tickets please!\" and snaps holes in the tickets with his punch.\\n\\nThe train clatters past ball fields and bridges, past backyards and ponds. \\n\\nMain streets flash by. \\n\\nThe view changes every second. \\n\\nHello town, good-bye town. \\n\\nOn to the next town.\\n\\nThe Commuter Train slows with creaking brakes. \\n\\nAnnouncements crackle. \\n\\nSome words get lost: \"We are arriving at Ghblighrrfzze.\" \\n\\nThe train stops at a small station. \\n\\nPassengers off, passengers on.\\n\\nAs the Commuter Train waits, another train roars past on another track. \\n\\nA larger train.\\n\\nA bright blue Passenger Train hurrying between cities.\\n\\nThe train is late so up in the cab of the engine, the engineer pulls back the throttle.\\n\\nThe Passenger Train powers forward. \\n\\nIt hurtles past barns and farmhouses. \\n\\nThe engine is so big it makes other big things look small.\\n\\nThe engineer sits very still but his fingers are always moving. \\n\\nPushing levers, turning dials. \\n\\nHe taps a blue button -long, long, short, long-and the horn blares out across a valley of fields and steeples. \\n\\nAs the train approaches a rail crossing, it sounds like a storm. \\n\\nAs the train passes, it sounds like dropped pots and pans.\\n\\nAs the train leaves, it sounds like the da dum da dum of a beating heart.\\n\\nThen, silence. \\n\\nBut up ahead the Passenger Train keeps going, thundering into the outskirts of a Midwestern city filled with smokestacks and factories and belching steam. \\n\\nTracks weave in and out. \\n\\nSmall animals scurry under the tracks.\\n\\nThe Passenger Train crawls over the tracks through a jungle of gravel, wires, and dirt. \\n\\nEverything smells of grease and rust and burnt toast. \\n\\nThe train lurches up to the station. \\n\\nBells ring, doors open. \\n\\nPassengers off, passengers on. \\n\\nTall men with red caps unload luggage and wheel it through the echoing hall.\\n\\nIn the rail yard next to the station, another train works. \\n\\nAn orange Freight Train loading up. \\n\\nIt grumbles under its breath as railcars are hauled and hitched to its back.\\n\\nThe railcars are filled with steel, concrete, oil, wheat, corn, and lumber. \\n\\nThings used to make other things. \\n\\nSturdy things. \\n\\nAll crammed in containers the color of tomatoes and eggs.\\n\\nThick white letters cover the railcar sides. \\n\\nGraffiti paints their sides, too. \\n\\nAfter the railcars are linked into one long train, the Freight Train creeps out of the city and across the Great Plains.\\n\\nIt rolls past wheat and prairie grasses.\\n\\nPast silos and barbed wire.\\n\\nPast a lone hawk circling under a big western sky.\\n\\nThe Freight train rolls slower than slow.\\n\\nSo slow it’s hard to tell it’s moving.\\n\\nAs if the train and the clouds above were having a race to see which can go slower.\\n\\nSlow, sloooow.\\n\\nAnd like the clouds, the train does not stop even as it inches up among low hills.\\n\\nThen, another train passes.\\n\\nA dark green Overnight Train switchbacking westward.\\n\\nIt climbs over the Rocky Mountains through snow flurries and pine forests.\\n\\nThe train curves along icy rivers and shoots through tunnels (where its chatter turns into a whisper). \\n\\nThere are no roads outside.\\n\\nJust eagles, elk, and turkeys.\\n\\nAs the sun lowers, passengers gather in the dining car, where the waiter sways down the aisle with her tray.\\n\\nShe doesn’t spill a thing.\\n\\nPlates of meat loaf, potatoes, ice cream, and pie.\\n\\nA movable feast.\\n\\nIn the sleeping car, two girls unfold seats into beds and make the room their own. \\n\\nLittle sink, little shower. \\n\\nEverything little. \\n\\nThe girls sleep as the train curls through the mountains and into the night.\\n\\nThe moon rises.\\n\\nWherever the train goes, the moon follows.\\n\\nWhen the train stops, the moon stops.\\n\\nWhen the train starts, the moon starts.\\n\\nSometimes it hides behind a ridge.\\n\\nThen-hello friend- reappears. \\n\\nThe train rests in small towns.\\n\\nPassengers off, passengers on.\\n\\nStars blink in the cold air, lights blink on the horizon, and the Overnight Train pushes into the deep hours of the night and wakes to morning sun.\\n\\nPassengers wake to biscuits, butter, jam, and coffee.\\n\\nOutside, everything is different.\\n\\nMountains have turned into orchards, snow into grass, boulders into cattle. \\n\\nNow, accelerating into view across a wide green valley, one last train passes.\\n\\nA sleek and white High-Speed Train, blurring a streak across the land.\\n\\nSchwooosshhhh. \\n\\nThe High-Speed Train flies.\\n\\nIt glides over bridges and marshes, by bays and highways.\\n\\nInside, it is cool and quiet.\\n\\nThe train is a small world moving through a larger world.\\n\\nPassengers read or type, One whispers in her phone: \"We’re almost there.\\n\\nWe’ll see you soon.\"\\n\\nThe High-Speed Train races toward the city on the coast and the passengers prepare for the end of their journey.\\n\\nThey close their books, they pack their bags, they think about what’s next.\\n\\nA clean bed, a warm dinner.\\n\\nThey are almost home.\\n\\nAnd with a slowing turn into the station and an easing of speed and a sigh of brakes and a gentle last thunk, the train stops.',\n",

       "\"_BOOK_TITLE_ : Andrew_Lang___Prince_Prigio.txt.out\\nCHAPTER I. -LCB- Chapter heading picture : p1.jpg -RCB- How the Fairies were not Invited to Court .\\nOnce upon a time there reigned in Pantouflia a king and a queen .\\nWith almost everything else to make them happy , they wanted one thing : they had no children .\\nThis vexed the king even more than the queen , who was very clever and learned , and who had hated dolls when she was a child .\\nHowever , she , too in spite of all the books she read and all the pictures she painted , would have been glad enough to be the mother of a little prince .\\nThe king was anxious to consult the fairies , but the queen would not hear of such a thing .\\nShe did not believe in fairies : she said that they had never existed ; and that she maintained , though The History of the Royal Family was full of chapters about nothing else .\\nWell , at long and at last they had a little boy , who was generally regarded as the finest baby that had ever been seen .\\nEven her majesty herself remarked that , though she could never believe all the courtiers told her , yet he certainly was a fine child -- a very fine child .\\nNow , the time drew near for the christening party , and the king and queen were sitting at breakfast in their summer parlour talking over it .\\nIt was a splendid room , hung with portraits of the royal ancestors .\\nThere was Cinderella , the grandmother of the reigning monarch , with her little foot in her glass slipper thrust out before her .\\nThere was the Marquis de Carabas , who , as everyone knows , was raised to the throne as prince consort after his marriage with the daughter of the king of the period .\\nOn the arm of the throne was seated his celebrated cat , wearing boots .\\nThere , too , was a portrait of a beautiful lady , sound asleep : this was Madame La Belle au Bois-dormant , also an ancestress of the royal family .\\nMany other pictures of celebrated persons were hanging on the walls .\\n`` You have asked all the right people , my dear ? ''\\nsaid the king .\\n`` Everyone who should be asked , '' answered the queen .\\n`` People are so touchy on these occasions , '' said his majesty .\\n`` You have not forgotten any of our aunts ? ''\\n`` No ; the old cats ! ''\\nreplied the queen ; for the king 's aunts were old-fashioned , and did not approve of her , and she knew it .\\n`` They are very kind old ladies in their way , '' said the king ; `` and were nice to me when I was a boy . ''\\nThen he waited a little , and remarked : `` The fairies , of course , you have invited ?\\nIt has always been usual , in our family , on an occasion like this ; and I think we have neglected them a little of late . ''\\n`` How can you be so absurd ? ''\\ncried the queen .\\n`` How often must I tell you that there are no fairies ?\\nAnd even if there were -- but , no matter ; pray let us drop the subject . ''\\n`` They are very old friends of our family , my dear , that 's all , '' said the king timidly .\\n`` Often and often they have been godmothers to us .\\nOne , in particular , was most kind and most serviceable to Cinderella I. , my own grandmother . ''\\n`` Your grandmother ! ''\\ninterrupted her majesty .\\n`` Fiddle-de-dee !\\nIf anyone puts such nonsense into the head of my little Prigio -- '' But here the baby was brought in by the nurse , and the queen almost devoured it with kisses .\\nAnd so the fairies were not invited !\\nIt was an extraordinary thing , but none of the nobles could come to the christening party when they learned that the fairies had not been asked .\\nSome were abroad ; several were ill ; a few were in prison among the Saracens ; others were captives in the dens of ogres .\\nThe end of it was that the king and queen had to sit down alone , one at each end of a very long table , arrayed with plates and glasses for a hundred guests -- for a hundred guests who never came !\\n`` Any soup , my dear ? ''\\nshouted the king , through a speaking-trumpet ; when , suddenly , the air was filled with a sound like the rustling of the wings of birds .\\nFlitter , flitter , flutter , went the noise ; and when the queen looked up , lo and behold !\\non every seat was a lovely fairy , dressed in green , each with a most interesting-looking parcel in her hand .\\nDo n't you like opening parcels ?\\nThe king did , and he was most friendly and polite to the fairies .\\nBut the queen , though she saw them distinctly , took no notice of them .\\nYou see , she did not believe in fairies , nor in her own eyes , when she saw them .\\nSo she talked across the fairies to the king , just as if they had not been there ; but the king behaved as politely as if they were real -- which , of course , they were .\\nWhen dinner was over , and when the nurse had brought in the baby , all the fairies gave him the most magnificent presents .\\nOne offered a purse which could never be empty ; and one a pair of seven-leagued boots ; and another a cap of darkness , that nobody might see the prince when he put it on ; and another a wishing-cap ; and another a carpet , on which , when he sat , he was carried wherever he wished to find himself .\\nAnother made him beautiful for ever ; and another , brave ; and another , lucky : but the last fairy of all , a cross old thing , crept up and said , `` My child , you shall be too clever ! ''\\nThis fairy 's gift would have pleased the queen , if she had believed in it , more than anything else , because she was so clever herself .\\nBut she took no notice at all ; and the fairies went each to her own country , and none of them stayed there at the palace , where nobody believed in them , except the king , a little .\\nBut the queen tossed all their nice boots and caps , carpets , purses , swords , and all , away into a dark lumber-room ; for , of course , she thought that they were all nonsense , and merely old rubbish out of books , or pantomime `` properties . ''\\nCHAPTER II .\\n-LCB- Chapter heading picture : p9.jpg -RCB- Prince Prigio and his Family .\\nWell , the little prince grew up .\\nI think I 've told you that his name was Prigio -- did I not ?\\nWell , that was his name .\\nYou can not think how clever he was .\\nHe argued with his nurse as soon as he could speak , which was very soon .\\nHe argued that he did not like to be washed , because the soap got into his eyes .\\nHowever , when he was told all about the pores of the skin , and how they could not be healthy if he was not washed , he at once ceased to resist , for he was very reasonable .\\nHe argued with his father that he did not see why there should be kings who were rich , while beggars were poor ; and why the king -- who was a little greedy -- should have poached eggs and plum-cake at afternoon tea , while many other persons went without dinner .\\nThe king was so surprised and hurt at these remarks that he boxed the prince 's ears , saying , `` I 'll teach you to be too clever , my lad . ''\\nThen he remembered the awful curse of the oldest fairy , and was sorry for the rudeness of the queen .\\nAnd when the prince , after having his ears boxed , said that `` force was no argument , '' the king went away in a rage .\\n-LCB- Prigio reading a book : p11.jpg -RCB- Indeed , I can not tell you how the prince was hated by all !\\nHe would go down into the kitchen , and show the cook how to make soup .\\nHe would visit the poor people 's cottage , and teach them how to make the beds , and how to make plum-pudding out of turnip-tops , and venison cutlets out of rusty bacon .\\nHe showed the fencing-master how to fence , and the professional cricketer how to bowl , and instructed the rat-catcher in breeding terriers .\\nHe set sums to the Chancellor of the Exchequer , and assured the Astronomer Royal that the sun does not go round the earth -- which , for my part , I believe it does .\\nThe young ladies of the Court disliked dancing with him , in spite of his good looks , because he was always asking , `` Have you read this ? ''\\nand `` Have you read that ? ''\\n-- and when they said they had n't , he sneered ; and when they said they had , he found them out .\\nHe found out all his tutors and masters in the same horrid way ; correcting the accent of his French teacher , and trying to get his German tutor not to eat peas with his knife .\\nHe also endeavoured to teach the queen-dowager , his grandmother , an art with which she had long been perfectly familiar !\\nIn fact , he knew everything better than anybody else ; and the worst of it was that he did : and he was never in the wrong , and he always said , `` Did n't I tell you so ? ''\\nAnd , what was more , he had !\\nAs time went on , Prince Prigio had two younger brothers , whom everybody liked .\\nThey were not a bit clever , but jolly .\\nPrince Alphonso , the third son , was round , fat , good-humoured , and as brave as a lion .\\nPrince Enrico , the second , was tall , thin , and a little sad , but never too clever .\\nBoth were in love with two of their own cousins -LRB- with the approval of their dear parents -RRB- ; and all the world said , `` What nice , unaffected princes they are ! ''\\nBut Prigio nearly got the country into several wars by being too clever for the foreign ambassadors .\\nNow , as Pantouflia was a rich , lazy country , which hated fighting , this was very unpleasant , and did not make people love Prince Prigio any better .\\nCHAPTER III .\\nAbout the Firedrake .\\nOf all the people who did not like Prigio , his own dear papa , King Grognio , disliked him most .\\nFor the king knew he was not clever , himself .\\nWhen he was in the counting-house , counting out his money , and when he happened to say , `` Sixteen shillings and fourteen and twopence are three pounds , fifteen , '' it made him wild to hear Prigio whisper , `` One pound , ten and twopence '' -- which , of course , it is .\\nAnd the king was afraid that Prigio would conspire , and get made king himself -- which was the last thing Prigio really wanted .\\nHe much preferred to idle about , and know everything without seeming to take any trouble .\\n-LCB- The King at his desk : p15.jpg -RCB- Well , the king t\""

the   conspiracy theories and in a company   as disney with his many movies   theme parks and clear millions and   millions of dollars is indisputable that   interesting stories always come out   behind the usual plots that already   we know there are many who check a   feeling of disappointment knowing that   the stories are not as pink as   they seem but the truth is that all   we are astonished by the crossed conspiracies   and the various points where several   of these stories are often coupled   revealing certain mysteries that never   We thought they could have been   solved before   1 in toy story 2 and so it was abandoned   by the mother of andy hess and had many   difficulties related to   abandonment and they may have a   good reason its original owner the mother   andy left her years ago for   start andy's hat is   practically similar to jesse's in the   movies maybe because it was part of the   her mother's cowgirl costume when she was   girl in a memory where the owner   Jesse's original can be seen almost   textually as a young version of   andy's mother   2 elsa to kill sans are brothers clear   what will you think is not possible but   let me clarify t

cup of beauty and the beast ' 4 all   pixar movies take place in   the same universe this is one of the   most possible theories that exist the   first pixar movie photo and story   in 1995 but the first movie in   proven issues is serious that   it came out in 2012 but it takes place in the   medieval Scotland in it measure discover   magic that turns your mother into a bear if   we advance a little it is credible that this   magic continued to exist through the   history what would explain all the   wonderful and strange creations of   pixar the writer jon negroni in his   book the theory of pixar tells us more   about all connections between   pixar characters and films   5 beautiful read the story of Aladdin in   beauty and the beast 'bella happens a lot   time reading books makes sense then   it was one of his favorite hobbies   but if you pay attention to the subject of one of   your books maybe you do not see it to the   first the book is about very places   distant fights of swords spells of   magic a prince disguised does not   it sounds like another movie from the 90's   Yes disney aladino   6 frozen entangled and the little mermaid have   place in the same universe in frozen there   a little scene of rapunzel and flynn   at the elsa coronation we also know   that in the beginning of frozen parents   of elsa giana died when the   ship where they traveled the last thing we saw   of them is that they were getting on   boat let's admit that frozen has   place in norway and entangled in germany   two very reasonable theories if we   we guide on clues that they left in the   movies the two countries are a   distance from a short boat trip   then it is completely possible that   elsa giana's parents were in   way to the rapunzel ceremony and   flynn when they suffered the accident here   is when it gets crazier you know what   country is between germany and norway   Denmark who lives in Denmark   ariel the little mermaid then if ariel is   he stole what was in the sunken ship   where the parents of elsa giana died   7 Captain Garcia killed the mother of   ariel one of peter's mermaid friends   bread looks a lot like the mother of   ariel had in the work the little mermaid   they reveal to us that a fierce pirate murdered   to the mother of ariel   8 in up a tall adventure   karl has always been dead what if   we make this sad movie make you   cry even more what if instead of carl   and travel to South America the old man was   reaching beyond to find his   beloved wife is somewhat complicated but   it makes some sense although it sounds

\"(exciting orchestral music) - Hi, I'm Mike, OMGiri on Instagram. And I'm here at Disney's Hollywood Studios to make another bento box\\nshaped like a Disney character. I'm pretty excited about\\nSolo: A Star Wars Story, in theaters May 25th. So how about we make a\\nbento of Han's copilot, everyone's favorite Wookiee, Chewbacca. - [Stormtrooper] T-32401, stay alert. Rebel traitors could be anywhere. Or anyone. - [T-32401] You there. - [Stormtrooper] Have you\\nseen anything suspicious, civilian? - No sir, I'm just making a bento box. - [T-32401] All right. Proceed. - Whew. Chewbacca's head and body\\nare one large sushi roll. Or as I like to call it,\\nthe Chewy Chewie Sushi Roll. Our filling is gonna be cucumber, avocado, crab stick, and cream cheese. The rice for this sushi\\nroll is Chewbacca brown, which I got by cooking\\nthe rice in black tea. In restaurants, the chef\\nwill use a bamboo mat to roll the sushi roll. But today, I'm just using plastic wrap, so I can have more control over the shape. There goes the crab stick. A stripe of cream cheese. Avocado and cucumber. I stopped short on one side of the roll. That way I can shape it to be\\nthe top of Chewbacca's head. I trim the end, and into\\nthe bento box it goes. I'm going to use the\\nrest of the brown rice to make his arms and\\nthe parts of his face. I have all sorts of little cookie cutters that I use to make shapes. But you can also just\\nuse the back of a spoon. Of course, the reason I use plastic wrap is 'cause the rice is so sticky, and it won't stick to the plastic wrap. For a lot of Chewie's facial\\nfeatures and other details, I'm cutting it out of nori, or roasted seaweed sheets. This is Chewbacca's lower\\njaw, and the little stripes of nori make it really look like hair. This is his upper lip, and that's the little\\nstripe under his nose. A piece of nori for the\\ninside of Chewbacca's mouth, and then I can set those\\ntwo rice pieces in place. There go his eyes. Now I can put his arms in place. The pieces of olives will\\nhelp raise the arms up a bit. And then more nori for\\nthe top of Chewie's head and his cheeks. For the whites of his eyes, two tiny circles of white cheese. Two really tiny dots\\nof nori for his pupils. More white cheese for his teeth. It helps if you keep the\\ncheese nice and cold. A slice of black olive\\nmakes Chewbacca's nose. I'm using cream cheese to hold\\ndown Chewbacca's bandoliers, which I made out of two\\nstrips of purple carrot. Little pieces of white cheese\\nto complete his bandoliers. And pickled carrots to\\nfill in the background and really make him pop. And there he is, Chewbacca! From Solo: A Star Wars Story. For 190 years old, he sure looks great. - [T-32401] Your loyalty\\nseems misplaced, citizen. - [Stormtrooper] You, with the holoscan. Let's go. - Bye, guys!

It is now being used by an increasing number of major organizations, including NASA and Google. Updated for Python 2.4, The Python Cookbook, 2nd Edition offers a wealth of useful code for all Python programmers, not just advanced practitioners. Like its predecessor, the new edition provides solutions to problems that Python programmers face everyday. It now includes over 200 recipes that range from simple tasks, such as working with dictionaries and list comprehensions, to complex tasks, such as monitoring a network and building a templating system. This revised version also includes new chapters on topics such as time, money, and metaprogramming. Here's a list of additional topics covered: Manipulating text Searching and sorting Working with files and the filesystem Object-oriented programming Dealing with threads and processes System administration Interacting with databases Creating user interfaces Network and web programming Processing XML Distributed programming Debugging and testing Another advantage of The Python Cookbook, 2nd Edition is its trio of authors--three well-known Python programming experts, who are highly visible on email lists and in newsgroups, and speak often at Python conferences. With scores of practical examples and pertinent background information, The Python Cookbook, 2nd Edition is the one source you need if you're looking to build efficient, flexible, scalable, and well-integrated systems.\",\n",
