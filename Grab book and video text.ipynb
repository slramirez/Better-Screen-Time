the   conspiracy theories and in a company   as disney with his many movies   theme parks and clear millions and   millions of dollars is indisputable that   interesting stories always come out   behind the usual plots that already   we know there are many who check a   feeling of disappointment knowing that   the stories are not as pink as   they seem but the truth is that all   we are astonished by the crossed conspiracies   and the various points where several   of these stories are often coupled   revealing certain mysteries that never   We thought they could have been   solved before   1 in toy story 2 and so it was abandoned   by the mother of andy hess and had many   difficulties related to   abandonment and they may have a   good reason its original owner the mother   andy left her years ago for   start andy's hat is   practically similar to jesse's in the   movies maybe because it was part of the   her mother's cowgirl costume when she was   girl in a memory where the owner   Jesse's original can be seen almost   textually as a young version of   andy's mother   2 elsa to kill sans are brothers clear   what will you think is not possible but   let me clarify t when you   asked about this theory to the   Frozen producers replied that the   king and queen of allendale survived   When the ship collapsed, they escaped   island they had a son and they found the

romantic relationships with men   wild and both love the yellow color   but there is something more precise in tarzan   Terquin to use a set of tea as   drums that looks a lot like the teapot   and cup of beauty and the beast ' 4 all   pixar movies take place in   the same universe this is one of the   most possible theories that exist the   first pixar movie photo and story   in 1995 but the first movie in   proven issues is serious that   it came out in 2012 but it takes place in the   medieval Scotland in it measure discover   magic that turns your mother into a bear if   we advance a little it is credible that this   magic continued to exist through the   history what would explain all the   wonderful and strange creations of   pixar the writer jon negroni in his   book the theory of pixar tells us more   about all connections between   pixar characters and films   5 beautiful read the story of Aladdin in   beauty and the beast 'bella happens a lot   time reading books makes sense then   it was one of his favorite hobbies   but if you pay attention to the subject of one of   your books maybe you do not see it to the   first the book is about very places   distant fights of swords spells of   magic a prince disguised does not   it sounds like another movie from the 90's   Yes disney aladino   6 frozen entangled and the little mermaid have   place in the same universe in frozen there   a little scene of rapunzel and flynn   at the elsa coronation we also know   that in the beginning of frozen parents   of elsa giana died when the   ship where they traveled the last thing we saw   of them is that they were getting on   boat let's admit that frozen has   place in norway and entangled in germany   two very reasonable theories if we   we guide on clues that they left in the   movies the two countries are a   distance from a short boat trip   then it is completely possible that   elsa giana's parents were in   way to the rapunzel ceremony and   flynn when they suffered the accident here   is when it gets crazier you know what   country is between germany and norway   Denmark who lives in Denmark   ariel the little mermaid then if ariel is   he stole what was in the sunken ship   where the parents of elsa giana died   7 Captain Garcia killed the mother of   ariel one of peter's mermaid friends   bread looks a lot like the mother of   ariel had in the work the little mermaid   they reveal to us that a fierce pirate murdered   to the mother of ariel   8 in up a tall adventure   karl has always been dead what if   we make this sad movie make you   cry even more what if instead of carl   and travel to South America the old man was   reaching beyond to find his   beloved wife is somewhat complicated but   it makes some sense although it sounds

\"(exciting orchestral music) - Hi, I'm Mike, OMGiri on Instagram. And I'm here at Disney's Hollywood Studios to make another bento box\\nshaped like a Disney character. I'm pretty excited about\\nSolo: A Star Wars Story, in theaters May 25th. So how about we make a\\nbento of Han's copilot, everyone's favorite Wookiee, Chewbacca. - [Stormtrooper] T-32401, stay alert. Rebel traitors could be anywhere. Or anyone. - [T-32401] You there. - [Stormtrooper] Have you\\nseen anything suspicious, civilian? - No sir, I'm just making a bento box. - [T-32401] All right. Proceed. - Whew. Chewbacca's head and body\\nare one large sushi roll. Or as I like to call it,\\nthe Chewy Chewie Sushi Roll. Our filling is gonna be cucumber, avocado, crab stick, and cream cheese. The rice for this sushi\\nroll is Chewbacca brown, which I got by cooking\\nthe rice in black tea. In restaurants, the chef\\nwill use a bamboo mat to roll the sushi roll. But today, I'm just using plastic wrap, so I can have more control over the shape. There goes the crab stick. A stripe of cream cheese. Avocado and cucumber. I stopped short on one side of the roll. That way I can shape it to be\\nthe top of Chewbacca's head. I trim the end, and into\\nthe bento box it goes. I'm going to use the\\nrest of the brown rice to make his arms and\\nthe parts of his face. I have all sorts of little cookie cutters that I use to make shapes. But you can also just\\nuse the back of a spoon. Of course, the reason I use plastic wrap is 'cause the rice is so sticky, and it won't stick to the plastic wrap. For a lot of Chewie's facial\\nfeatures and other details, I'm cutting it out of nori, or roasted seaweed sheets. This is Chewbacca's lower\\njaw, and the little stripes of nori make it really look like hair. This is his upper lip, and that's the little\\nstripe under his nose. A piece of nori for the\\ninside of Chewbacca's mouth, and then I can set those\\ntwo rice pieces in place. There go his eyes. Now I can put his arms in place. The pieces of olives will\\nhelp raise the arms up a bit. And then more nori for\\nthe top of Chewie's head and his cheeks. For the whites of his eyes, two tiny circles of white cheese. Two really tiny dots\\nof nori for his pupils. More white cheese for his teeth. It helps if you keep the\\ncheese nice and cold. A slice of black olive\\nmakes Chewbacca's nose. I'm using cream cheese to hold\\ndown Chewbacca's bandoliers, which I made out of two\\nstrips of purple carrot. Little pieces of white cheese\\nto complete his bandoliers. And pickled carrots to\\nfill in the background and really make him pop. And there he is, Chewbacca! From Solo: A Star Wars Story. For 190 years old, he sure looks great. - [T-32401] Your loyalty\\nseems misplaced, citizen. - [Stormtrooper] You, with the holoscan. Let's go. - Bye, guys!
